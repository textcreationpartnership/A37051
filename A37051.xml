            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the Devout Chriſtian.</head>
            <p>I Need not uſe any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to recommend unto you the uſe of this Little Treatiſe; your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Diſpoſition will I hope (after a peruſal) find that pleaſure and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that is intended; for doubtleſs you will meet here
<pb facs="tcp:31416:4"/>with ſuch conſiderable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances to your Devotions, as will not ſuffer you to reject them, becauſe of the ſmallneſs of the Book, the obſcurity of the Author, or the frequency of the Subject: For here are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome Obſervations, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and Reaſons, that are not uſually met with, and proceed from a long Experience in the Service of God and Religion.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that I firſt deſigned theſe Meditations
<pb facs="tcp:31416:4"/>only for my Countrey Neighbours, at the Requeſt of ſome Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they being in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, at a diſtance from other like Books of Devotion, of which they were altogether ignorant: And I conceived they might more readily embrace my Advices in this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with me, and eſteem of my Perſon. The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage therefore, and Style was made the more eaſie and plain, that it might
<pb facs="tcp:31416:5"/>be levelled to their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; for I deſign not Words, but Things; not to wrap them in a Cloudy Diſcourſe, or Lofty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but to lay them open to the apprehenſion of the Vulgar Sort.</p>
            <p>And to the Helps and Encouragements of Prayer, I have purpoſely added divers Meditations and Prayers, that you might have here the Practice, as well as the Rules of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Let not therefore
<pb facs="tcp:31416:5"/>your Familiarity with the Works of other Divines, cauſe you to miſtake this as uſeleſs, or a <hi>repetition</hi> of the <hi>Gift of Prayer;</hi> you will find the Deſign to be otherwiſe; to enable the Soul, not ſo much to ſpeak the Words, as to recommend the Things that we want to the Divine Bounty, with that Decency, Humility, Reſpect, and Qualifications that are required from us, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Servants of ſo Holy a Majeſty.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31416:6"/>
            <p>Therefore, as I deſign nothing but your Aſſiſtance and Comfort, I doubt not but to meet with favour and acceptance from all Rational and Grateful Chriſtians, whoſe buſineſs is Devotion and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

            <p>THERE is no Duty of Religion more excellent, more divine, more beneficial, and of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Concernment to us all, than that of Prayer. For in reſpect to God, it is an Adoration, and an open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of all his glorious Attributes at once; and the beſt and onely return that we poor Men are capable of, for all the Expreſſions of his unwearied goodneſs; and in reſpect of Man the Petitioner, it is the moſt effectual means to ſupply our continual wants, to procure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the divine Graces in our Souls, to arm us againſt all the attempts of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31416:8"/>Misfortunes, and prediſpoſe us for an Eternal Communion with our great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. So many and ſuch real Advantages which we reap from the performance of this our Duty, are ſufficient Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtir up our negligence, and to oblige us to preſent our ſelves very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Prayer to the Divine Majeſty, whoſe power is anſwerable to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of an infinite extent, and may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover the folly of thoſe frivolous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that men of corrupt minds and manners invent to diſſwade us from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For when a conſiderable Benefit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, together with the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our God, if the Senſe of Duty be not ſufficient to move us, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own good ſhould cauſe us to ſet aſide all other conſiderations. Now in this caſe of Prayer, here is conſiderable, nay, aſſured and unſpeakable Benefits mentioned before, ariſing from thence to our Bodies and our Souls. The proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Health, the Riches, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Bleſſings, and the very breath of the former, with all other Temporal things relating to its good, are in the Hands, and at the diſpoſal of our God; they proceed from his Bounty, and are commonly obtain'd by our zealous Prayer; for God, an unchangeable Truth, hath promiſed in his holy Word, to have a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31416:8"/>ſpecial regard to the Prayer of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, to hear the groaning of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, to looſe them that are appointed to Death. That he will cauſe him that asketh to receive, he that ſeeketh from him his Neceſſities, ſhall find them in due time. That he will grant whatſoever we ask in Chriſt's name. That he will hear the Prayers of all Fleſh, and perform their deſires. That he will open the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of his Mercies, to ſuch as call upon his Name, and grant them their requeſts. In a word, God promiſeth that he will freely, beſtow upon us all thoſe earthly advantages which Men ſo highly eſteem and ſtand in need of, in conſideration of our devout and Conſtant Prayer, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the more laſting and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Riches of the Soul <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9. <hi>John</hi> 14.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9.</p>
            <p>If ſome prophane Varlets that contemn God and Religion, and neglect this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nevertheleſs ſeem to be ſo happy as to be loaden with theſe Temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they enjoy them not with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs and content as a praying Soul: That which to the latter is a real Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, proves a preſent Curſe to the former, and an aggravation and the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wel of their Vices. Neither can they find that ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in good which naturally it yields,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31416:9"/>and a good Chriſtian taſtes; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fears and apprehenſiens which commonly attend upon a diſorderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, with the gripings of an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Conſcience, ſour and poiſon all the Mercies of Heaven; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſecret Curſe that accompanies the Wicked in the neglect of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, changes the very nature of the greateſt Bleſſings. Let therefore the Care, Diligence, and Frugality of our Fore-fathers make never ſo much proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us: Let God's Providence put into our hands a plentiful Eſtate, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Power and Authority, as ſoon as we are born, Prayer is as needful in ſuch a Condition, as if we were daily to expect the continual Supplies of God's Bounty to entertain our beings, as if we had no ſuch aſſurance of a livelihood in the World. Humane Greatneſs, if not ſupported and animated by Goodneſs and Piety, is like thoſe unweildy Bodies, the ſooner brought to ruine for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, required to keep them in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſerve them from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachings of the Diſeaſes unto which their groſſneſs and fatneſs are inclinable. Worldly promotion can never be well maintain'd and continued, but by that Providence from whence it firſt proceeds. Reaſon as well as Religion obligeth us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31416:9"/>to ſeek from God's mercy the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Stores of good things which he hath bountifully beſtowed upon us, ſeeing that without it they muſt needs decay, and ſhrink away to nothing. Think not thy ſelf, O Man, leſs indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thy God, becauſe he hath given thee, by whole Sale, all the Riches of the Earth, which he diſtributes to others but by retail, and that therefore thou dependeſt not ſo much upon his Power, and needeſt not ſo much his continual aſſiſtance, as others of the loweſt rank of Men. Sooner may the Moon and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Stars yield their light, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Influences, without the Aſpect of the Sun; ſooner may the Earth bring forth its variety of Creatures, without the Celeſtial Globes, than that Man, tho' never ſo Rich and Powerful, ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without his God. When therefore <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of all the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> built the famous Temple of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> he placed the King's Bed-Chamber near to God's Sanctuary, and cauſed a door to lead into it, whereof the Key was tranſmitted with the Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and always in the King's poſſeſſion, that this might mind him of his dependency upon his God, and to ſeek from him thoſe Bleſſings and the protection that he continually wanted in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31416:10"/>that lofty Station of Honour. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Subſiſtance, the preſervation of our Eſtates in the higheſt degree of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the continual aſſiſtance of our God, needful in the greateſt abundance, proceed from his bountiful hand, and are obtainable by, and promiſed to our Prayers, ſhould not this oblige us to draw near with Humility to the Throne of God's Grace, to offer up this cheap Sacrifice always ready and at hand, ſo acceptable to our good God?</p>
            <p>I confeſs he is acquainted with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digencies, and his infinite knowledge needs not be informed of the things that we want in the World, for he knows our neceſſities before we ask, and our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in asking. He underſtands our moſt boſom thoughts. He ſees and foreſees what is moſt uſeful both for our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Tho' this Conſideration may ſeem to render our Prayers frivolous, and not ſo needful as if God were ignorant of our Wants. Yet Chriſt and his Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, require and adviſe us both by their Examples, and Commands, to lay open our Neceſſities in Prayer to our gracious God; and Nature it ſelf calls upon us to ſeek from him a ſupply to our daily Wants. For we muſt not look upon Prayer as a ſimple information of our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31416:10"/>deſires and eſtate, but as an open acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God's Liberality and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; not as an increaſe to his knowledge, which is in it ſelf Infinite, and can admit no augmentation, but as a means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Wiſdom, to increaſe and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our happineſs. Neither muſt we look upon Prayer as an obligation laid upon God, to commiſerate our poor Condition, but as a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>hod to diſpoſe and render us fit to receive the Mercies of Heaven, and as that unto which God's promiſes of Earthly and Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are annexed. Which the divine Wiſdom hath ſo much the more cauſe to encourage, and we ſinful Men to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, becauſe it is the moſt agreeable to God's magnificence and unlimited Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to Man's weakneſs and poverty. Becauſe it is the moſt excellent Armour to ſtrengthen us againſt the aſſaults of worldly Caſualties, the ſafeſt ſhelter where we may retreat when purſued by Storms, and Tempeſts. The beſt Pourveyor, to procure us all things needful for our maintenance and beings: And becauſe it is the readieſt means to entertain and increaſe that familiarity with our God, which muſt of neceſſity precede that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Union and Communion with him, which we ſhall enjoy in the Eſtate of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, God will have us draw nearer to him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31416:11"/>by degrees, and not leap from our vile Fellowſhip with Sin and the World, into an immediate fruition of his unſpeakable Bliſs. As there is a vaſt diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two extreams, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to paſs from the one to the other in a moment, or without ſome mediums that are appointed to rid us of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the one, and prepare us for the acceptance of the other. It is for that good purpoſe that his Wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to ſend us the aſſiſtance of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces, by which our Souls are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed from the filthineſs of our ſinful habits, but alſo enabled to this bleſſed Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with God in Prayer, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all ſpiritual Joy and Comfort.</p>
            <p>Let not therefore any Perſwaſion or diſcouragement hinder thee, O Chriſtian, from viſiting often thy God in Prayer. Let not the ſinfulneſs of thy Actions, the vitiouſneſs of thy Diſpoſition, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of worldly buſineſs, the Cares and Troubles of the World, nor any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of God or of thy ſelf, cauſe thee to omit this beneficial Duty. What if thou art ſinful, or naturally indiſpoſed to ſo holy a Performance. Remember Chriſt in Heaven ſits at God's Right Hand to intercede for thee, to render thy Prayers effectual, to ſanctifie thy Groans, and offer them up to thy God. What
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31416:11"/>if thou makeſt thy Addreſſes to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Being, of an infinite Power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: If thy diſpoſition be ſuitable to the Duty, thou mayeſt draw near with confidence to the Throne of his Grace, for he is thine Heavenly Father, he deſires nothing more than to render thee happy, and to beſtow upon thee his Mercies. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his gratious invitations and many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in his holy Word. <hi>Come unto me all ye that travel, and are heavy laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. <hi>The Lord is good and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon him,</hi> Pſal. 36.5 <hi>Before we call he will anſwer, and while we are yet ſpeaking he will hear,</hi> Iſaiah 65.24. <hi>To all that turn to him, the Lord is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Joel 2.13. <hi>He will not break the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax,</hi> Matth. 12.20. Shall his mercy be ſo ready to receive thee, and wilt thou be ſo unworthy to draw back? Shall his goodneſs long to beſtow upon thee what thou wanteſt, and wilt thou be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to contemn it? Shall his Love deſire to be acquainted with thee by thy frequent Addreſſes, and wilt thou be ſo ungrateful to ſlight his offered kindneſs?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31416:12"/>Take notice of the juſt puniſhment of thoſe ungracious Souls whom his Wiſdom invites in vain to her ſelf. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded, but ye have ſet at naught all my Counſel, and would none of my Reproof. I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25, 26.28.</p>
            <p>Adverſity may have that Power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken many, who in proſperity from one year to another ſcarce think of praying to their God: But what can ſuch expect in reaſon from his Bounty, which they in their flouriſhing Eſtate deſpiſe or neglect? Thoſe Services can never be thought real and ſincere, unto which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity drives Men; and thoſe perſons that make a mock of this Duty at any time, cannot probably receive from it, in their greateſt urgencies, the benefits they expect. It is therefore Wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to practice that which may ſtand us in good ſtead, and without which we ſhall aſſuredly be at a loſs. Prayer may help and comfort thee, O Man, when all other helps and comforts forſake thee, when thy Riches and thy Guards, thy Treaſure and thy Friends, thy Power and thy Glory ſhall leave thee to be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31416:12"/>with the Pangs of a Diſeaſe, or ſuffer thee to paſs alone and naked through the dark and mournful Vale of Death. In a word, when all the World can yield thee no aſſiſtance, Prayer alone may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and relieve thee. I cannot preſcribe to any perſons the times and moments for every one to make his Addreſſes to his God. There is no hour of the day nor night, but the divine goodneſs is ready to receive the humble Application of a dutiful Supplicant. No wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us to <hi>pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing.</hi> Which words we muſt not ſo underſtand, as to ſpend all our time in this Duty, leaving all other neceſſary Employments of Life, as the antient la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Hereticks, ſirnamed by the Fathers, <hi>Euthicks,</hi> taught by their Doctrine and Practice. But this Command may admit of a threefold interpretation, equally neceſſary for the obſervance of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may go far to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the Apoſtles Counſel, by ſending up unto God without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our hearty deſires, our ſighs, and groans, when we are buſie in our daily works to implore his needful aſſiſtance, and protection. The conſtant buſineſs of this Life ſhould not hinder thee from this preparation for the next, nor the incumbrances of the World clog thy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31416:13"/>Soul from this elevation to its God, with whom an uninterrupted correſpondence will wonderfully advance our preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as well as diſpoſe thee, O Man, for a more bleſſed Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in imitation of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and of other Religious Men men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in holy Writ, we may pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, by a conſtant performance of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at thoſe times that chiefly require a divine aſſiſtance, and an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods continual Mercies. <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Morning, and at Noon will I pray, and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my Voice,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 55.17. And <hi>Daniel</hi> could not be frighted, with the ſear of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fury, from praying three times a day to his God. In the Morning when our Eyes are open again to behold the wonderful works of God's Power and Wiſdom in the Creation and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; it concerns us to praiſe his divine Attributes, that ſhine as bright as the Sun over our Heads. When we receive a freſh expreſſion of God's goodneſs, in keeping us ſafe from the dangers of the preceding Night, in adding another day to our Lives, and a continuance of all his Temporal Favours, doth not Juſtice and Reaſon call upon us to be as mindful of God's Bounty, as he is of our neceſſities, and to be as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31416:13"/>of our thanks, as he is of his Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? When in the Morning thou art going about thine Employments, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that all thy labours will be to little purpoſe without God's Bleſſings, that thou art going through a world of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Spiritual and Temporal, a World of Enemies ſubtle, malicious, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that beſiege thee on all ſides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it not thine Intereſt to beg the favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of that good Creator, that thy Soul and thy Body may be preſerved in the midſt of all their envious attempts, that thy deſigns and undertakings may be ſucceſsful, thy labours fruitful, and all thy proceedings proſperous.</p>
            <p>At Noon when thou ſeeſt thy Table covered with God's good Creatures, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſtrengthen thy Body, and taſteſt the ſweetneſs of his Mercies at a diſtance, thou can'ſt do no leſs than lift up thy hands and thine Eyes, in prayer, to this bountiful Creator, as well to praiſe him for ſuch a freſh expreſſion of his liberality, at that time before thee, as to implore his Bleſſing needful to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the means uſed to recruit thy ſtrength and preſerve thy weak Body.</p>
            <p>In the Evening when the Curtains of the Night are ſpreading about thee, when thou art lying down to refreſh thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Body with reſt, when thou knoweſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31416:14"/>not the dangers that hang over thine head, and haſt no other means to avoid them, but God's gracious protection, ſhould'ſt thou not, for thine own ſafety, deſire his favourable providence and all-ſeeing eye, to watch over thee, ſhelter, and defend thee from all ſpiritual and corporal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies? Were we but ſenſible of the miſchievous temper of ſome of thoſe airy Spirts that fly about us, thoſe many and ſubtle Devils that plot our deſtruction; did we but underſtand their Power, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and their unavoidable Aſſaults and propinquity, we ſhould need no other Arguments to perſwade us to arm our Selves with God's merciful protection when we lay our Heads down upon our Pillows. How ſoon ſhould we periſh, if God and his Holy Angels were not as watchful to keep us, as thoſe Enemies of Mankind are watchful to deſtroy us! They wait continually for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to vent their Natural diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and by the Evil Thoughts, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dreams, unuſual and unnatural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, of the Mind, they diſcover themſelves in our ſleep, and their hatred againſt us. Who knows but that God, who holds them faſt in Chains, as ſo many fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beaſts, will let them looſe to puniſh thy contempt of his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and neglect of this Duty, if thou
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31416:14"/>forgetteſt to call upon thy God. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore, O Man, thy weak, thy frail and perillous Condition. Thy Life is but a Breath, thy Riches uncertain, thy Glory but a ſhadow, thy Power but for a time, thy Proſperity but like a Dream, thy Beauty but a fancy, and thy Health always beſieged with many Diſeaſes, thy Body and Soul ſurrounded with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thy preſent Eſtate, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never ſo flouriſhing, is in a continual want of God's favour, protection, and Bleſſings; whether thou riſeſt or layeſt thy ſelf down, lift up therefore thine Eyes and Hands in Prayer to this good God, to ſupply thee with thoſe things that thou ſtandeſt in need of, but chiefly in the Morning and in the Evening. Let theſe be the Solemn and conſtant times of thine Addreſſes to God. Offer up unto him the Morning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Prayer, and the Evening of Praiſe. In the Church of the Jews, theſe were the appointed times to call upon God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.40. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.15. And Chriſt our Saviour, whoſe Example the Name and Profeſſion of Chriſtianity call upon us to follow, was wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate theſe hours to Prayer and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.46.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion binds us to this Duty of Prayer in the beginning and cloſe of the Day, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31416:15"/>oblige us then to renew our Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with God, too often interrupted by our daily miſcarriages, let not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Buſineſs, the Cares and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the World, the frightful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Sin, diſcourage or hinder thee from this conſtant and neceſſary Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with thy God.</p>
            <p>When a ſudden occaſion calls thee away, ſo that thou art not able to offer up thy deſires in ſuch a ſolemn manner as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at theſe uſual times; make uſe at leaſt of the ſhorter Prayers of the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Ejaculations of the mind. Let thy Soul be with God, tho' the World hurry away thy Body. Spare a thought unto that merciful God, who hath ſpared thee to attend upon thy neceſſary Occaſions, and who can render thine undertakings either proſperous or unhappy, as he ſees convenient. Venture not out into the wide and troubleſom World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſafeguard of God's Protection. And enter not into the ſhadows of the Night, this Couſin and remembrancer of Death, without his merciful allowance, who hath the Keys of Death and of Hell.</p>
            <p>The third Interpretation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Advice, <hi>To Pray without ceaſing,</hi> Is to be always in a diſpoſition ſit for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſhake off all Impediments, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of Sin, which hinder us, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31416:15"/>the Soul may ſtill be in a readineſs with the Wings of Faith and Love, ſtretched towards Heaven, always ready to take its Flight.</p>
            <p>The troubles and vexations of the World ſhould rather animate thee, and inflame thy Devotion with an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and certain aſſurance to find more favour in him than in all inferior enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His Holy Spirit can convey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort into thy Soul, when the World fills thee with Sorrow. He can ſend thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and ſweetneſs to qualify all other bitterneſs; for by the means of Prayer, a Chriſtian can keep himſelf in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Temper, that will not ſuffer him to be ſenſible of many misfortunes and Croſſes, and ſo ſecure his Soul, that all outward Accidents ſhall do him no harm.</p>
            <p>I know that the ſenſe and conſcience of Guilt, is wont to eſtrange us from God, and interrupt all correſpondency between his mercy and our Souls. And Reaſon ſeems to forbid us, together with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we owe to ſo holy a Being, when our hands are reeking with Blood, or our Body comes from the commiſſion of any other grievous Offence wilfully acted, to preſume to preſent our ſelves before the Throne of God's Grace immediately, without any delay. I confeſs that ſuch unhappy Criminals ought to pauſe a while
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31416:16"/>upon their woful Condition, and the ſenſe of their Guilt ought to move them to Repentance and Sorrow, before they offer up their Prayers to God, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, this Sacrifice will meet with no better acceptance than that of <hi>Cain,</hi> or that of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> or that of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Rebellious Company, whoſe Offerings were ſo much the more diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe they were encouraged by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to God, and to his Servant <hi>Moſes.</hi> But yet I would adviſe a Chriſtian to ſpend and delay no more time, but only to prepare himſelf the better for this ſacred Duty. Suffer not thy Sin to grow old, nor this Burden to lye too long upon thy Soul, for fear it ſhould leave an Impreſſion that thou wilt not be able to remove in haſte. In ſuch a caſe, tho' Guilt ought and will interrupt and break off our continued Prayers to God, yet it ought not to drive us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, but rather caſt us into the Publicans Diſpoſition in the Goſpel. He would not lift up ſo much as his Eyes to Heaven, but ſmote upon his Breaſt, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner:</hi> Or into the Bleſſed temper of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31416:16"/>as one of thy hired Servants.</hi> A greater Humility in ſuch a Caſe, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Perſons and Prayers for God's acceptance.

               </gap>hes to be to him. The alteration in our behaviours ſhould cauſe an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Souls, before we preſent our ſelves before God. Inſtead of alienating our minds from him, the conſideration of our weakneſs ſhould, incourage us to fly to him by prayer, and ſeek from his all-ſufficiency ſtrength againſt future Temptations. In ſuch a caſe, I would have a repenting Chriſtian underſtand that God, our merciful Creator is not ſo ſoon eſtranged from us, as we are from him. The Sin that diſorders our Souls, and cauſeth us to ſhun his preſence, may cauſe him to correct us for our good, but it will never oblige him to caſt us away, if there be any ſenſe of our Guiltineſs in us, accompanied with the hopes of his Mercy. Therefore this ought not to be long an impediment to our Prayers, or the cauſe to interrupt our daily correſpondency with God, Morning and Evening; for we ſee it often happen by woful experience, that by ſuch an omiſſion of our Duty, many are inſenſibly brought into dangerous Snares. And God withdraws his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31416:17"/>from ſuch as were not mindful to take it along with them. To avoid ſuch miſcarriages and dangers, Prayer is as needful to a Chriſtian in the beginning and cloſe of the day, as Armour and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to a Souldier, and Shoos and Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a Traveller, to defend him from the injuries of the Way and Weather.</p>
            <p>It emboldens the Soul againſt all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, it gives Life and Heart to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and makes him walk every where, and lye down with <hi>David</hi>'s Confidence. <hi>Tho' I walk through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear no ill, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff they comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 23. <hi>Surely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the days of my Life,</hi> Pſal. 4.6.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in the midſt of a danger, at the Tidings of Loſſes or Succeſſes, at the beginning of any Buſineſs of weight or moment, and at ſeveral other times and occaſions, it concerns us to addreſs our ſelves in Prayer to God, the chief and only Author of all Temporal and Spiritual happineſs; for as this Devotion will diſappoint the miſchievous intent of Evils and Croſſes, it will infallibly draw a Bleſſing upon all our undertakings. I have therefore endeavoured in this Book to furniſh you, my Chriſtian Brethren, with all the Prayers that are ſuitable for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31416:17"/>many Occaſions, and Caſualities, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, needful in theſe wicked and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times, in which we now live.</p>
            <p>If you offer them up in the manner as you ought, you need not doubt of the Succeſs. The Prayer of a devout Soul hath an invincible Power. The whole Creation is not able to reſiſt or render in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual the religious Prayers of a Child of God. <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Prayers arreſted the Sun in the middle of its Courſe. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer dryed up the Waters of the Red Sea. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Prayers undermined the Walls of <hi>Jericho.

For the efficacy of Prayer depends not upon the holineſs of the Petitioner, but upon God's promiſes, that are unchangeable, Chriſt's Merits that are truly meritorious, and his interceſſion that is unreſiſtable. At the right hand of God, where he ſits above this unconſtant World, he is employed in offering up the requeſts of his Members and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rvants on Earth and there before the Mercy Seat, to perfume them with the Frankineenſe of his Paſſion, that they might be acceptable to our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whilſt we have ſuch a prevailing Mediator, never doubt of the ſucceſs of a Prayer, procceeding from an humble Soul, ſit for the acceptance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of our merciful Saviour.</p>
            <p>And if at any time thou feeleſt thy ſelf indiſpoſed, or not able to offer up thy Prayers with that Devotion that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, be not therefore diſcouraged, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not of the ſucceſs, know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is not ſo much thy weakneſs as thy negligence, not ſo much thy inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as thy ſloth and indiſpoſition, that clogs thy Prayers, and ſtops them in their aſcent to Heaven. Know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31416:19"/>that God regards more humility, truth, and ſincerity, than the flouriſhes of Wit, and the excellency of the language, or the vehemency of the expreſſion in all thy Requeſts. That the Sighs and Groans of a broken heart, or of a devout Soul, are more powerful with God, than the ſtrongeſt Arguments or the longeſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. God is not wont to proportion his mercies, only to our deſervings or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but rather out of his inexhauſtible Treaſuries, to take and beſtow upon us Men, beyond all merits and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſlack not thine Endeavours to pray well, God's greatneſs and thine eſtate in relation to him, calls for the greateſt Reſpect, the profoundeſt Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the exacteſt care, the moſt fervent Zeal and earneſtneſs that thou art capable of. God is not to be courted with ordinary Devotion. His Bleſſings are not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a ſlothful hand, and a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Soul. The diſtance betwixt God and us vile Men, ſhould be expreſſed by the humility of our Souls and Bodies, and our Prayers offered to ſo excellent a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, muſt have an excellency to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the Throne of his Grace. For that purpoſe we muſt take notice of, and obſerve theſe following directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all our Addreſſes to God.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:31416:19"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> let a ſhort Meditation upon God, his Power, Glory, Sufficiency, infinite Preſence, Goodneſs, Knowledge and Riches precede your Prayers; with ſome Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon your ſelves, your ſinfulneſs, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the former experience of God's goodneſs; that ſuch Conſiderations as theſe may cauſe you to ſhake off all neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ſloathfulneſs, and help to baniſh from your Souls all undecency, careleſneſs and miſapprehenſions, uſually found in the devouteſt perſons. We are naturally too much unmindful of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that we owe to our God; too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the performance of our Duties; too fond of the World and its Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Therefore this Meditation muſt ſtir us up, and pre-diſpoſe us for this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conference with our Maker. It muſt withdraw all our minds from all other intangling thoughts, that we may with more liberty ſet our ſelves entirely apart for this important Duty. We muſt rid our ſelves of thoſe things that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entangle us when we preſent our ſelves before our God, and draw near to him with ſuch thoughts as theſe.</p>
            <p>I, poor wretched and weak Man, Duſt and Aſhes, am going to ſpeak to, and petition a God, the Creator of the World, a Holy and Divine Majeſty, an incomprehenſible Spirit, which ſills Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31416:20"/>and Earth with his infinite preſence. He is at my Elbows, and takes notice of my behaviour in my Soul; and obſerves all the wandrings of the Mind in every corner of this wide World, and ſees and hears our wants and neceſſities. How careful muſt I be to appear with reſpect before him? He is Holy, and abhors all filthineſs; I muſt therefore baniſh all ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, polluted, and idle imaginations at this moment. He is as juſt as he is good, ready to puniſh irreverence, but much more inclinable to reward Humility and Devotion; how devout therefore ſhould my Soul be in his preſence? How cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect and humble before him, who is an all-ſeeing Majeſty, and a conſuming Fire. The indiſcreet Devotions of the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> cauſed the Fire from the Lord to fall upon and conſume them. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi>'s unſeaſonable officiouſneſs, and the impudence of the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> in drawing near to God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, were ſeverely puniſhed; and ſhall I preſume to draw near to my God with careleſneſs and indiſcretion? Shall I eſcape if I venture before him, without due conſideration? Shall I expect any gracious returns of thoſe prayers that are offered up with ſo little grace and dread of God's Power, with ſo little ſenſe of his glory and Majeſty. O let
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31416:20"/>my Soul be ſilled with the fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſo fearful and holy a Being. Let my mind be ſeaſoned with ſuch a dread of him, that may not fright me from him, but rather oblige me to draw nearer to him with more Devotion and Humility. If we entertain ſuch thoughts as theſe, they will cleanſe our. Souls from all that ſaperſluity, which will otherwiſe diſgrace and ſpoil all our holy performances. A little pauſe therefore before Prayer, is needful for this purpoſe; however it is an Act of Wiſdom, in ſo weighty a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to proceed on with caution and warineſs; and this little recollection of our ſelves, which I recommend to every devout Soul before Prayer, (chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſolemn and publick Prayers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God in the publick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) cannot but be of a great uſe, and very inſtrumental to prepare us for that Duty; for thereby we may ſee what there is in us able to impede us in our addreſſes to God, and what is likely to hinder a favourable return of our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; beſides, it ſavours much of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that God's greatneſs requires from us, together with our Relation to him. <hi>Keep thy foot,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the Sacrifice of Fools.</hi> Eccleſiaſt. 5.1. That is, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31416:21"/>thou goeſt to appear before God's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, keep thy ſelf with watchfulneſs and circumſpection, and underſtand thy ſelf, thy diſpoſition, and what thou art, and what thou doſt; that this ſacred Frankincenſe of Prayer may be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, with the Ingredients neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and from a. Soul rightly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that purpoſe, you muſt never come to God with any known ſin unrepented of; that is, with any ſin near and dear unto our Souls, which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain with a Reſolution, never, or not yet to part with: For not only the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word of God aſſures us, that <hi>God heareth not Sinners,</hi> John 9.31. but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo teacheth us, that it conſiſts not with his Wiſdom, to liſten to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch as will not hearken to his Commands; to beſtow his Bleſſings and Mercies upon ſuch unworthy Souls, as will not leave a ſin for his ſake; or, as prefer the filthy Pleaſures of the Fleſh to the ſincere Joys of God's ſavour, and the real advantage which ſlow from thence in abundance. Therefore, by the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he ſpeaks thus to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners; <hi>When you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; when you make many Prayers, I will not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31416:21"/>hear.</hi> The cauſe of this ſeverity is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the next words; <hi>becauſe your Hands are full of Blood.</hi> All other ſins as well as blood guiltineſs are wont to divert God's Mercies from us, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thoſe good things, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we might enjoy. Our Prayers in ſuch a caſe, without this due Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſavours of the greateſt impudency, and Atheiſtical boldneſs; becauſe we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the obtaining of God's Riches and Favours to our unworthy Beings, and preſent before his all-ſeeing Eye, Bodies diſtempered with Vice, <hi>Hands full of Sin, Eyes ſwelling with Pride;</hi> or bearing the marks of Contempt of his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and a Soul that would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him, were it not for our Wants, and God's Riches. The Prayers of ſuch a Perſon will prevail no more upon God than the Sacrifice of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; for he accepts not the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings preſented by foul hands: Purity and Innocency are required in ſuch as come before God: And tho' none of us can pretend to an abſolute freedom from ſin, and from thoſe wicked propenſities to vice, which render our Prayers inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; yet every one of us may cleanſe our ſelves from all actual Tranſgreſſions by Repentance, and make ſome amends by a repeated reſolution againſt our belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31416:22"/>Sins, and by an inward and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſorrow, before we appear in God's preſence, for our paſt miſcarriages; for unleſs we appear in that temper, our moſt juſt and excellent Prayers, will avail us nothing; they will not be accepted, if they proceed from a Soul bewitched with the deceitful Allurements of Sin. The Devil's Slave can never be fit to appear before the God of liberty, till the Bolts and Chains of Hell be ſhaken off: He ſhall never meet with acceptance with a Jealous God, who is already betroathed, and inſeparable from ſin, the great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his Glory. How unſeaſonable and odious were the Devotions of <hi>Zimri,</hi> when in the publick Congregations of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their Sins in God's preſence, he had a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Woman at his ſide? How unwelcome were the Addreſſes of a proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> whoſe Prayers were the expreſſions of his Pride and Vanity? <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifices were not pleaſing to God, becauſe there was a mixture of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt his Offerings; therefore ſuch Prayers as proceed from impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and vice, are odious to God.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, in ſuch a Caſe, the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not in a diſpoſition fit to receive God's Mercies; for ſin diſcompoſeth us, and while we retain it in our Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31416:22"/>both the Action and the Habit of ſin conſpire together, to intercept and deprive us of all gracious returns of our Prayers from God. It ſills the Soul full of jealouſies, fears, apprehenſions, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and inſtead of Love, it begets an hatred of, and an averſion to God, which will never ſuffer us to draw near in that manner, as his infinite goodneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited liberality require; ſo that unleſs true repentance intervene between our Sins and our Prayers to our Maker, they will rather provoke his Juſtice, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with his Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you will have your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers acceptable to God, you muſt offer them with that attention and intention of the mind, that ſo weighty an action, and the greatneſs of God's Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: For to what purpoſe is it to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and be preſent in a praying Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, if we be no more concerned in the Devotion, than the Timber and the Stones of the Fabrick; if our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e preſent without our Souls? God demands from his People ſpiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Services; which are not to be performed with the outward part alone; the Mind and the Underſtanding muſt be active, and the Soul and all its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ought to be concerned in this Spiritual worſhipping of our great God.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31416:23"/>As God is an Unity without Diviſion, whatſoever is offered to him, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this Unity, by a total Conſecration of it ſelf, chiefly in that Chriſtian Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where all the divine Attributes are acknowledged, and wherein the Soul as well as the Body is to reſign it ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to God. Dead Sacrifices under the Law were abominable, and bodily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions alone under the Goſpel, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful to God, and injurious to our ſelves; for they commonly proceed from the multiplicity of Worldly buſineſs that poſſeſs the Soul, from an unmindfulneſs of God, and a want of an Holy fear of his Divine Majeſty, from a careleſneſs of our Duty, or from the diſturbances and luſts of the Fleſh, that ſteal away our Thoughts as well as our Affections from God's Holy Worſhip, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the advantages that we might expect from a due performance of our Duty. To prevent ſuch ill conſequences, the Chriſtian in Prayer ought to mind the weighty Buſineſs in hand, and not only at the cloſe of every Petition, in imitation of the Primitive. Church of Chriſt, to ſubſcribe and declare his aſcent and conſent to the Requeſts offered up to God, by the univerſal <hi>Amen,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to expreſs inwardly in the Soul, what is outwardly pronounced and ſpoken, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31416:23"/>to be ſeriouſly attentive to every Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, as the rational Soul is able to expreſs it ſelf, as well as the animal part doth with the Tongue, and that by an internal Word and Faculty proper to it, that muſt ſpeak, or elſe God will not hear; for that intent, it is neceſſary to hearken with a Religious attention to the Prayers which proceed from our own, or others Lips, and endeavour to hear that part in the Devotion which is appointed for us. It is neceſſary to ſet aſide all other Worldy buſineſs, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage our ſelves and our minds from all other incumbrances, to ſix them to the Duty they are employed in, and to tye and ſettle them with the dread of God's preſence; ſo that our thoughts may not take the liberty to wander up and down from this holy exerciſe: And when we are in Prayers, we muſt ſet a watch at the door of our Senſes, forbid entrance to all ſudden Accidents, and, in a word, ſummon all the thoughts of the Mind, and faculties of the Soul, to render their homage to God's Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and not to ſuffer them to ſtraggle from the weighty buſineſs in hand. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is the Example of that Noble and Couragious Youth of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whoſe Office it was to burn Frankincenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he ſacrific'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31416:24"/>to his Gods; tho' a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coal was caſually fal'n into his open ſleeve,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Val Max.</hi> l. 3. c. 3.</note> and did there conſume both his Veſtment and his Fleſh, leſt he ſhould ominouſly and unhappily interrupt the publick Sacrifice of his Prince, he perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his buſineſs to the end, through all the Torments, and would not ſo much as complain. How religious were ſuch, and other Heathens, in the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their falſe Gods! Nothing was able to cauſe them to interrupt their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice! And ſhall we Chriſtians mingle in our Devotions to the true Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, vain, idle, wanton and laſcivious thoughts and actions? Shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very accident and caſualty be able to take us off from the Service we are about? Yet this we ſee moſt commonly happens both in our publick and in our private Addreſſes to God, for want of a due reſpect and dread of God's preſence, of which we ſhould at ſuch times be really and moſt ſenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Affections of the Soul ought to be moved and concerned in the offering up our Requeſts, and our Petitions ought to receive that qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them as is ſuitable to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, cauſe, and intent of our Addreſs. Our praiſing of God muſt be performed with an holy and reverend freedom, and a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31416:24"/>real ſenſe of our Obligations: Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts muſt be ſent up to God, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and an acknowledgment of our undeſervings: Our Confeſſions of ſin muſt be ſeaſoned with ſorrow, and a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of amendment: Our Promiſes, Vows, and Engagements, muſt proceed from an hearty reſolution, and a ſenſe of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages and weakneſſes: In ſhort, all our Prayers muſt be the outward expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the inward affections of the Soul, which ought to qualifie and animate them; for unleſs our Hearts be thus concerned, the Prayer is but from the Tongue, the Soul hath no part in it; 'tis but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and production of our Imagination, but no real Devotion of the mind; 'tis a Worſhip in jeſt and not in earneſt, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to an Allſeeing Eye. Such heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſervices are ſo full of Imperfections, that in reaſon we can never expect any gracious returns from a Juſt and Wiſe God, who would not admit neither the Blind nor the Lame to draw near to his Holy Altar, to offer Sacrifice, tho' of the Prieſtly Race, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.18. If un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, the want of theſe Members excluded Men from God's Service, how much the rather under the Goſpel, when the nobleſt Member is wanting, the Heart and its Affections? A Goſpel Worſhip muſt be an hearty Worſhip,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31416:25"/>that only is ſufficient to obtain accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It was God's Complaint of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they <hi>honoured God with their Lips, whilſt their heart was far from him.</hi> They are guilty of the ſame Formality, who frequently attend at Prayers without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their hearts to be concerned in the Devotion; it ſhould be therefore our care, to ſtir up our affections with all the conſiderations of want, neceſſity, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advantage, experience, duty, God's preſence, and whatever may have the greateſt influence upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And that our Affections may be the more inflamed, we muſt kindle them with an Holy Zeal, which muſt burn, not ſo much with the ſenſe of want, as with an earneſt and unfeigned deſire to Glorifie our Maker; however, both may very well contribute to inflame our Affections in the Divine Worſhip of our God in Prayer. Now this Zeal need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all our Addreſſes, is that holy violence that ſtrains our Affections in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties, and gives that perfection to the Action, which otherwiſe they would want; it is accompanied with a diſſidence of our ſelves, and a ſtrong reſolution to worſhip God with the utmoſt of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; it is quickned by the fears and apprehenſions of being guilty of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſloathfulneſs, which might diſpleaſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31416:25"/>our gracious God, and ſtop the current of his Mercy; it ſills the Soul full of Jealouſie, which awakens all its faculties and powers, to the performance of the preſent Duty: And as our great Saviour, when he expell'd the Merchants and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Changers out of his Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> was animated by a Divine Zeal for God's Glory; ſo a Chriſtian that is govern'd by the ſame Spirit, and Zealous Affection for his God, drives out of his mind all worldly Buſineſs, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Profit and Advantage, that God may be worſhipped in this Spiritual Temple, the Soul, without the interruption and clamours of our ſenſual and ſecular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, where Sin and the Devil commonly inſinuate themſelves too much, <hi>John</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As there is a care to be taken of our perſons, and manner of offering up our Prayers, that they may be in ſome meaſure anſwerable to God's glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and our own vile and mean Eſtate; we muſt likewiſe mind the things that we petition for, that they be not contrary to God's revealed, or ſecret Will: God's Will muſt regulate ours, in all our actions; for Chriſt our Saviour, teacheth us by his Bleſſed Example, to be inſtrumental in, as well as deſirous of the performance of God's will on Earth; and Reaſon tells us, that God being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31416:26"/>Agent, the great Maker and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the World, the Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Mankin'd, that all our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Wills ought to yield homage to his Pleaſure; in which ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is this advantage ariſing to our ſelves; thereby we compaſs and attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of all our deſires, an infallible happineſs; for the beſt ſelf-intereſt is a ſubmiſſion to that wiſe Agent, who is engaged to promote our Felicity and his Glory together, according to his promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>If in other actions of our life, God's Will ſhould be the Rule of our deſires, how much the rather in that weighty, and religious action of Prayer, where the Soul and the Body together, are to ſummon all their Faculties and Members, for the worſhipping of their great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Benefactor? for the chief intent of this performance, is the magnifying of God's glorious Attributes, which we can never do, if we ſuffer any of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers to oppoſe his Will, or contradict his Wiſdom, or queſtion his Alſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Goodneſs. The want of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould cauſe thee, O Man! to yield to his Wiſdom and Power; if thou expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a favourable return from his Bounty, thou muſt learn to court it by a dutiful ſubmiſſion to his Wiſdom and Governance,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31416:26"/>both in the things that thou deſireſt, and in the expectation of the time which he judges moſt ſeaſonable to grant thee thy requeſts: All impatiency in Prayer is guilty of indiſcretion, of prophane fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of diſreſpect, and diſeſteem of God's Wiſdom and Mercy. In this, and in all other acts of Devotion, Men muſt learn to prefer his Glory, whoſe goodneſs they want to the ſatiating of their own craving and importunate Appetites, and to give a check to the furious deſires of our corrupt Nature, when we find them proceeding beyond the Bounds limited by God and his Will, and our real hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which commonly are unſeparable.</p>
            <p>But there is a difference to be obſerved, according to the difference of the things that we deſire from God. For Spiritual Mercies, for Faith, Grace, Regeneration, Strength againſt Sin, Truth, Wiſdom, Knowledge, and other Bleſſings relating to God's immediate Glory, and our own Salvation, a Petitioner can never be too earneſt, zealous and impatient. Such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are to be wreſted, if I may ſo ſpeak, from our good God, by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and fervent Prayers. Violence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in other things, is approved of by Chriſt himſelf, in ſuch as intend to be partakers of Heaven's Kingdom; and an Holy importunity in Prayer, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31416:27"/>without a grant of the Requeſt, when we ask the divine Riches of God's Grace, unleſs we have, like <hi>Eſau,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited before all pretenſions to it; for God is as willing to beſtow them, as we to ſeek them; and their excellency is ſuch, that Men can never have, and deſire them too much. As <hi>David</hi> therefore, whoſe Soul was inſatiable on Earth, for Grace and divine Mercies, let us not give our ſelves any reſt, until we have obtained theſe Riches and Ornaments of the Soul, and the aſſurances of God's favour.</p>
            <p>But as Earthly proſperity and Bleſſings, relating to our better conveniency on Earth, are not of ſuch a value and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, our Requeſts for theſe things muſt be qualified accordingly; and becauſe in ſome Rules they may be prejudicial to our everlaſting Intereſt, we are to beg them always with a condeſcention to the Will and Wiſdom of our great God, who knows what is beſt for us, and moſt conducing to our real good. To deſire them too paſſionately, or without any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, is to Idolize the Creature, and to prefer it before the Creator; it is to give to thoſe Earthly and mean things, that affection which is due to God alone, and his divine Mercies. Nature I confeſs, will be always craving, and the ſenſe of our wants will cauſe us to cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31416:27"/>for a relief and remedy; but a good Chriſtian muſt give a check to thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions, in imitation of Chriſt our Saviour, whoſe Humanity was loth to taſte of the bitter Cup that was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him to ſwallow; therefore you may hear him deſire that it may paſs away, and that he may be excuſed to drink it; but immediately after he adds, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> The fulfilling of this will, we muſt prefer to the things that we moſt paſſionately deſire on Earth: As it ought to be our chief aim, it ſhould be our moſt zealous requeſt, and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt petition, to be placed at the cloſe of all our Prayers which we offer up for theſe pleaſant, glorious, and uſeful things on Earth, that draw away too much of our Affections. Likewiſe when we beg from God for the good things of this Life, we muſt take heed of two other intentions or affections of our corrupt Nature, that are able to render our requeſts moſt ſinful and abominable in God's Preſence.</p>
            <p>The firſt may proceed from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt principle of Covetouſneſs, when the Soul is poſſeſſed with an inſatiable ſpirit, that craves more than is needful, and forces it to deſire what is not really ours, to the prejudice of others; or from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, vain-glory, and immoderate care of the World, that may cauſe us to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31416:28"/>too paſſionately for its Vanities, as it may proceed from ſome Luſt that governs the Soul. All theſe, and other Principles of the like nature, as they are irregular, the Devotions that proceed from them can never be good; for all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in ſuch like Caſes tend to procure to our ſelves thoſe good things, that we purpoſe to abuſe, in the ſatisfying of our unruly and baſe affections. Such Prayers are Sacrifices of the Devil, and not of God; His Bleſſings, never ſo mean, are too good to be proſtituted to our ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts. We muſt not think to feed the Devil's Brats with the Milk and Mercies of Heaven. It is an ungrateful Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed, to convert that to God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour that proceeds from his Bounty. And it is the mark of a great indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and want of Piety, to ſeek from God the means to diſhonour his holy Name, and to employ the chief part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſuch a prophane and unworthy purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Affection is a Spirit of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Anger, Revenge and Hatred, which if we diſcover in that part of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where we are to implore his Bounty, we cannot probably expect any great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or any favourable return; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that the God of Mercy and Love, ſhould be favourable to inhumanity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31416:28"/>and revenge, that he will grant ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions as proceed from that affection, which is direct contrary to his Divine Nature and Commands. God muſt not, nor will not be made the Executioner of our vengeance, nor receive the Commiſſions from us to puniſh our wrongs. Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belongs to God; it is a bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to preſcribe to his Wiſdom either the method, time, or meaſure of inflicting i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon the greateſt Offendors. Therefore let us always caſt our ſelves upon him and his Juſtice, with a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ready to forgive the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Let us leave all our wilful Intereſts entirely to the diſpoſal of his Wiſdom, and not venture nor ſuffer our corrupt Nature to give him directions, how, and where to execute his wrath, chiefly in that part of his Service where our Buſineſs is to intreat him to ſuſpend the execution of his Juſtice from us, juſtly due for our Offences committed againſt his continued goodneſs: If he ſhews ſo much favour to us, he expects that we ſhould do the like to ſuch as have offended us, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our diſpleaſure. Our Prayers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be Imprecations and Curſes, all Gall and bitterneſs muſt be caſt away, and ſeparated from this Sacrifice to the God of Heaven, as the Gaul of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Victims</hi> was, when they offered them up to the ſuperior Gods.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:31416:29"/>
            <p>I confeſs that ſelf preſervation, God's glory, common juſtice, and the ſafety of our Friends, of the Church and Publick, may oblige us to petition Heaven for the diſappointment of the unjuſt deſigns of Wicked Men, tho' it be to their utter overthrow. <hi>David</hi> in his Divine Pſalms affords us many Examples to this purpoſe, <hi>Pour out thy Wrath upon the Ideathen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that have not known thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name,</hi> Pſal. 79.6. <hi>Let them be blotted out of the Pook of the Living, and not be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 69.28. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them in thy Wrath, conſume them that they may not be, and let them know that God ruleth in</hi> Jacob, <hi>unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> Selah. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.13. Theſe and ſuch like Prayers have an intent chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prevent the future Miſchiefs, which the Malice of God's Enemies, and of his Church, was likely to draw upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. They are intended to diſarm them, and take from them the ability or power which they would infallibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe oft to God's diſhonour, and the Prejudice of God's People, and innocent Perſons. They are intended to Petition God, that he would be pleaſed to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his own Cauſe, and declare his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the puniſhment of vile Contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Power and Authority. For
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31416:29"/>ſuch intents as theſe, we may ſometimes beſeech God to ſend down his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon our Enemies, as well as his Mercies; but out of a meer Principle of Revenge, or of an implacable hatred, to deſire the ruin of any that we diſaffect, is to concern God too much in our fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous quarrels, and to cauſe him to withhold the favours, which otherwiſe he might be willing to grant us, <hi>For with the ſame meaſure that we mete, it ſhall be meaſured to us again.</hi> Let therefore Men be never ſo much alienated from us, and ſeparated in judgments, deſigns, or Intereſts; let them purpoſe never ſo much our Ruin, if they be Chriſtians or but Men, that Chriſtian diſpoſition which Chriſt our Saviour recommends to us, both by his Commands and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, teacheth us to pray for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the proſperity of their Souls and Bodies, ſo that it may be without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable prejudice to God, his Church, the publick or our private happineſs: The Sacrifices of an implacable Spirit, will never find acceptance at the Throne of Grace. That good Saviour that prayed for his Murderers, teacheth us to ſuppreſs the ſenſe of all perſonal Wrongs, and not ſuffer our diſpleaſures to be vented in our Addreſſes to God.</p>
            <p>In this particular, as well as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31416:30"/>Nature will ſpeak when it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and complain for the Evils that burden us; it will petition for help and juſtice when it is grieved; and I cannot think but that this natural motion may be allowable, if it be kept within the bounds of Chriſtian Charity, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a diſpoſition ready to forgive the Injuries received, in caſe of amendment; and our Enemies become fit Objects of our Mercy and Forgiveneſs. But in ſuch Caſes we muſt take heed, that we ſuffer not our Reſentment of former wrongs, to ſpeak too loud in Prayer, and that we deſire not from God, that which neither becomes God's Wiſdom to grant, nor our modeſty and Chriſtian Charity to ask.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Faith muſt likewiſe be an ingredient in this part of God's Worſhip, as well as in the reſt: This Grace is the Life and Soul of Devotion, without which all our Addreſſes are to no purpoſe, <hi>For he that comes unto God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there is a double Duty that our Faith is bound to perform in Prayer. Firſt, it muſt make us ſenſible of God's preſence and all-ſeeing Eye; it muſt caſt the Soul into a dread of that divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who hears and ſees every Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31416:30"/>all over the World; it muſt awaken all our abilities, and quicken us with the conſideration of God's glorious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unto whom we offer up our Requeſts; it muſt repreſent him preſent, and as he is a God, a juſt, a powerful, and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Creator, to our imagination; but let the good Chriſtian take heed that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not his fancy to give any viſible ſhape to God's incomprehenſible Being: Our minds are too apt to be extravagant in this Caſe, and to commit that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Idolatry, which the Heathens were outwardly guilty of: This infinite Spirit is to be repreſented inwardly to Souls, without any ſuch contemptible appearance, unto which our imagination, inſtructed by our Senſes, is wont to confine him. His incomprehenſible Being muſt not be diſgraced by our weak and ſhallow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. Therefore in all our Addreſſes to him, our buſie imagination ought to be entertain'd with the Thoughts of the things we want, and deſire from God, and our Minds ſtopt with the notion of his Immenſity, and our belief ought to make us as ſenſible of his Preſence, as if he were viſible before our Eyes; this will baniſh all careleſs, idle, and wandering thoughts and negligence, and quicken us in the performance of this important Duty. The ſenſe of God's preſence will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31416:31"/>cauſe us to ſummon all our abilities, and rid us of all thoſe things that might be an impediment to our Prayers. And for want of it, Men are commonly ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and careleſs in their Addreſſes to God's Divine Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But there is another Duty that our Faith muſt perform in Prayer; that is, it muſt keep the Soul in an expectation of the grant of our requeſts, and aſſure us, that God is both willing and able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil our deſires in his due time; that he hath Goodneſs and Power enough in ſtore to reward us, and ſatisfie all our Wiſhes; nay, that he will give us the good things that we petition for, if they be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for us, and likely to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the promotion of his Glory on Earth. For that purpoſe Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us with this promiſe, <hi>Math</hi> 21.22. <hi>All things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he calls upon the ſloathful to <hi>ask,</hi> and aſſures them, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.7. that they <hi>ſhall have; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before his Crucifixion, he reproved his Diſciples for their backwardneſs in Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name, ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your Joy may be full.</hi> By theſe and ſuch like Promiſes, Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31416:31"/>us God's aſſiſtances and mercies, and deſires us to ſend up our Prayers to him with a lively Faith, and a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that he will grant us our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or ſo much of them as is needful for us. This Faith, or Perſwaſion muſt not be grounded upon ſuch a deceitful Foundation, as our Vertues, good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Excellency; Men are too apt to flatter themſelves with ſuch proud miſtakes, and to look upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as deſerving the favours that they petition for; and that in conſideration of their own Piety and Holineſs, God will infallibly hear their Prayers: Though our innocency may be a means to draw the Bleſſings of Heaven upon our Heads; it becomes not our Chriſtian Humility to rely upon our Merits, and claim God's mercies as due for our Services: If God is a Debtor to us, it is in regard of his Promiſes, and not of our deſervings, which cannot be in any wiſe proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to his Bleſſings. God may reward our Piety with the good things of this Life, and with a proſperous ſucceſs in all our undertakings, according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; he may vouchſafe his mercies to his faithful Servants, as well as keep them from the ſmart and fury of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that becauſe of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and abſtinence from the publick
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31416:32"/>Sins; but it becomes not the Humility of a Beggar, when he comes to the Throne of God's undeſerved Grace, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or claim more gracious returns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our former ſervices due to his Soveraignty over us: Beſides Men are commonly miſtaken, and we are apt to think too well of our ſelves; but tho' our Virtues ſhould be never ſo Heroick, and our lives never ſo exemplary, I would not adviſe any Petitioner to ſettle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Faith and Confidence of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of, and ſucceſs to his Prayers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that perſwaſion claims God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as Debts, and deſerves as ſevere a repulſe as that boaſting Phariſee in the Goſpel, whoſe Prayer was but a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God's diſpleaſure againſt him, whereas the Publican's Humility obtain'd a gracious forgiveneſs. Self-conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Prayer, is the worſt diſpoſition that we can bring, and diſcover in our Addreſſes to him, who knows the very bottom of our Souls; ſooner will the ſcandalous Sinner, who is ſenſible of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving render'd himſelf unworthy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Mercies, receive the effects of the tenderneſs of his Fatherly Love, rather than an over-confident and a proud Saint, that is ready to upbraid God with his continual Services.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:31416:32"/>
            <p>But as our confidence in Prayer muſt not proceed from an high Opinion that we have conceived of our ſelves, of our perfections or actions, ſo it ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, and our real Intereſt in him; our faith and aſſurance of God's acceptance, muſt eye his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and infallible Truth, and look upon the deſervings of an alſufficient Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in whom, and by whom we are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to a bountiful God; it muſt truſt upon Chriſt's interceſſion, that ſanctifies our imperfect Prayers, and offers them up for us to our Heavenly Father. Let his Mediation procure us admittance, and his Excellency purchaſe unto us a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable return; then only we may expect ſucceſs, when our Petitions are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Merits of a Crucified Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All ſuch requeſts, as our Saviour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſhall meet with acceptance, if we can be perſwaded of an aſſured ſucceſs, or if <hi>we believe.</hi> By which words he ſeems to encourage us to believe, <hi>that whatſoever we ask the Father in his name, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</hi> Experience teacheth us, that this promiſe is not to be underſtood in as large a Senſe as the words ſeem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, without any exception or reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for many things we may ask of God,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31416:33"/>which becomes not his Wiſdom and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care over us to grant; and our ignorance is ſuch, that we may petition for things with Confidence and Faith, which will be prejudicial to our ſelves, and God's glory on Earth. I cannot think that it is Chriſt's intent, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to offer up ſuch Prayers, with an aſſurance of obtaining our irregular and inconſiderate deſires; therefore for the better directions and comfort of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtian, let him know that he may ſafely be confident, and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that all Prayers tending to the ſalvation of his Soul, for the obtaining of grace, forgiveneſs of his ſins, ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptation, God will in his time grant him his Requeſt, if he be ſincere, and affectionate in his Prayer, according to our Saviour's Words, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.11. <hi>What Man is there of you, whom if his Son ask Bread, will he give him a Stone, or if he ask a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being Evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</hi> And in the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Luke, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> As God is as willing to beſtow ſuch divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as Men to ask; they may be as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31416:33"/>to obtain them, as God is free to grant: But for other things relating to our preſent and worldly Intereſt, we may ask with an aſſurance, that God if he ſees them fit for our good, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs give them, but if otherwiſe, he will make us ſenſible of his Liberality in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, for it is the manner of God's proceeding with his Children and Servants, to ſend ſuch returns to their Prayers, as are moſt for their advantage, not always anſwerable to their deſires. He keeps back the Bleſſings which he knows will be hurtful to them, or prejudicial to the publick good; and inſtead of them, he heaps upon them others which will prove more really for their benefit. Men fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee not the danger of God's inferior Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, good things may become hurtful to us through the Devil's malice, the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Temptations, and our Corruption within. As many Diſeaſes are fed and increaſed by that Food which God hath appointed to ſtrengthen the Bodies of the healthful, ſo likewiſe many inclinations grow worſe, by thoſe very Bleſſings which are granted to ſome, as the rewards of their Piety: In things therefore that are not always turned to a good uſe, and that are neither for the benefit of Men, nor the Glory of God, I would not have a Petitioner gratifie his corrupt Humour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31416:34"/>ſo much, as to be confident of the grant of his Requeſts; nor to flatter himſelf in a vain expectation of that which agrees not with the Wiſdom and Love of God for us. As therefore a devout Chriſtian muſt offer up ſuch Prayers, with this clauſe, <hi>(If it be God's good Pleaſure)</hi> let him not be too confident of obtaining his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that very manner that he deſires it, and with that improper limitation of the over-ruling goodneſs of our God, unleſs he is moved by ſome extraordinary impulſe of his holy Spirit in his Soul, to aſſure him of the grant, and unleſs he can diſcover the events of the time to come, by ſome unuſual Revelation. Some pious Souls often receive an anſwer to their Prayers before they riſe up, and God is pleaſed to comfort their droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits with a ſpeedy and a gracious return. As <hi>Hannah,</hi> who petitioned God for a Son, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. roſe up with a joyful Countenance, and a full aſſurance that God the Author of Life, would give her a Child. She had unburthened her ſelf of her ſorrows in Prayer, and her heart and Countenance were no more ſo ſad, becauſe ſhe had received ſome aſſurance of a favourable acceptance, of obtaining her Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> But there is one thing more that a devout Chriſtian muſt obſerve in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31416:34"/>Prayer to God; that is, the Duty of Perſeverance; ſlack not, nor be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the firſt repulſe, or for a delay. God grants not his Mercies, always as ſoon as we begin to ask. His goodneſs is to be courted by our zealous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for he grants many times to our perſeverance, what he denys to our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Woman of <hi>Syrophenicia</hi> met with a refuſal, and had not her patience overcome this Obſtacle, ſhe had never returned with the glad aſſurance of her Daughters recovery: If <hi>Jacob</hi> had not contended with the Angel, he had never been honoured with a Bleſſing: An holy and devout importunity, ſeldom or never departs empty from God's unwearied Bounty. He ſuffers for ſeveral cauſes beſt known to himſelf, his Servants to live a while in expectation of thoſe Bleſſings which he intends at laſt to beſtow upon them, that his Mercies might obtain with them a right eſteem, and be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued: That their Faith, patience, confidence in him, and all their Graces might be exerciſed and tryed the more, and that their ability for Prayer might be increaſed, by a conſtanter exerciſe, and all impediments of a Communion with our God may be removed; for that purpoſe it is to be obſerved, that his Providence caſts us into the want of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31416:35"/>many enjoyments, that when we ſeek them from God by Prayer, both the endeavour to obtain them, and the receiving of them, might turn to the everlaſting advantage of our Souls and Bodies. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the devout Chriſtian be diſcouraged, if God anſwers not his Requeſt as ſoon as he expects or deſires; for, beſides that it is a bold and indiſcreet Act, for us ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Creatures to limit the Wiſdom of our Creator's liberality, and to preſcribe to him the time and place, of opening his bountiful hand unto us; it is an act of Cruelty to our ſelves, and of impiety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, to be ſo impatient for the enjoying of thoſe things, which may, and doubtleſs will prove as prejudicial to us, as injurious to his honour. Take heed of murmuring for the want of Earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies. It was the great ruin of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> newly eſcaped out of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Bondage, and drew ſeveral Plagues upon their heads. As perſeverance, aſſiſted by the vertues of patience and Faith, is a bleſſed means to obtain and ſanctifie God's Mercies, both Spiritual and Temporal, ſo there is nothing that turns them ſooner into Curſes than impatiency, deſpair, and inſolent Complaints againſt God's Love or Power. Lift up always, O Chriſtian! thine Eyes and thine hands in expectation of God's time, as well as of God's Bleſſings.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31416:35"/>Be not weary to wait for the expreſſions of his Bounty, who is never weary to do thee good; he is not ſo unmindful as thou thinkeſt him to be; his delays or refuſals are more for thine advantage, than the enjoyments of thoſe mercies would be, which thou deſireſt with ſo much diſreſpect and impatience. As the knowledge of his power and goodneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our confidence and reliance upon him; his infinite Wiſdom demands from us, a reſignation of our ſelves and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to his diſpoſal, without diſtaſte or inſolent complaints of our proud nature, which grace teacheth us to check. The firſt ought to encourage our perſeverance in Prayer, as the conſideration of the laſt Attribute of God, ſhould teach us to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et the irreverent diſſatisfactions of our diſcontented minds.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtian obſerve, in publick and private Prayers to God's divine Majeſty, to offer them with the humility of the Body, as well as the devotion of the Mind. I have obſerved that our Nation chiefly, and every Congregation is full of irreverent and diſreſpectful Clowns, when we make our Addreſſes to God, either in Prayer, or praiſing of his holy Name. They obſerve not that decency and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which is due to the Excellency of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31416:36"/>our heavenly Father in his Worſhip, but appear moſt ſcandalous and prophane in the Eyes of Men, whatever may be their inward diſpoſition, which I conceive is to be gathered from the outward geſture of their Bodies. They come into God's preſence in ſuch a familiar manner, as if there were no difference between them and their great Creator, as if their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were not as much obliged to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him as their Souls, as if their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour were not to be concerned in their Devotions to God; and at the times of Prayer, they ſhew forth ſo much contempt of God, and of the Religion they profeſs, that none would take them to be Chriſtians, that underſtands not their Names, and knows not their Perſons; and further, I have obſerved that ſome of the more religious ſort, both in private and in publick, when they addreſs themſelves to God, omit ſometimes out of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and irreligious Cuſtom, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humility which the Body is obliged to render to its Creator and Benefactor in his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>For the redreſs of this open Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for the prevention of the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that may reflect from hence upon God and our Religion, in the Eyes of the World: Let me intreat every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Soul, never to offer to ſpeak to God
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31416:36"/>in Prayer, without obſerving and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that humility with his Body, which God's incomprehenſible Majeſty, and our vile condition requires indiſpenſibly from us all; from the higheſt to the loweſt: Reaſon as well as Holy Scripture enjoyns this obſervance; for if the whole man is bound to render Hommage to God, as he ſeems to intimate by thoſe Sacrifices under the Law, which were to be offered intire, without any diminution; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to expreſs the inward qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſition of the Soul, with the outward action of the Body, and make the World ſenſible of the ſincerity and piety of our intentions; juſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity require this from us; for ſeeing we have received our Bodies as well as our Souls from the Almighty hand of God, it is but juſt that they ſhould acknowledge his Soveraignty by ſome ſignificant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, when the Soul appears before him to do him reverence, or to crave his merciful aſſiſtance: It is but juſt, that this outward part of our ſelves as well as the inward, ſhould make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for all the divine favours that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late immediately to its ſubſiſtance; it is but juſt that this Body of ours, which is one day to be glorified in God's heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary, ſhould now glorifie God by the humbleſt and moſt devout po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and actions.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:31416:37"/>
            <p>I confeſs 'tis the uſual manner of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition to enjoin the cringings of the Body, more than the devout qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul; but I am ſure that it is a clowniſh and unmannerly Religion indeed, that ſuffers Men to approach in holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, without expreſſing any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Body. If you pleaſe to enquire into the behaviour of the holy Men of the Old and New Teſtament, you ſhall never find them praying in an irreverent poſture, neither ſitting nor leaning. Old <hi>Abraham worſhipped before God,</hi> Gen. 22.5. This worſhipping is an outward action of the Body, as well as the inward of the Mind; as may appear by <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.52. where <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant is ſaid to have <hi>worſhipped the Lord, bowing himſelf to the ground,</hi> when God had proſpered his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> bowed himſelf before God in his publick Addreſſes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.29. St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe was upon his knees in prayer with the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Acts.</hi> 20.36. And Chriſt our Saviour, whoſe Example ſhould prevail upon our negligence, was never ſeen in Prayer to God the Father, but either proſtrate, or kneeling upon the ground. This Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31416:37"/>of the Body is ſo eſſential a part of the publick worſhip of God, that its obſervance alone, hath cauſed the Holy Scriptures to give the Name of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God, to the Vileſt of Men, who were never acquainted with the internal and hearty Worſhip, as may be obſerved by what is recorded of <hi>Saul</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.31. And it is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.29. <hi>And when they had made an end of Offering, the King and all that were preſent with him, bowed themſelves and worſhipped.</hi> And in the next Verſe, <hi>Moreover Hezekiah the King, and the Princes, commanded the Levites to ſing praiſe unto the Lord with the words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and of Aſaph the Seer, and they ſang Praiſes with gladneſs, and they bowed their Heads and worſhipped.</hi> Likewiſe in the 8th. of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the ſixth Verſe. It is ſaid, that <hi>Ezra bleſſed the Lord the great God, and all the People anſwered</hi> Amen, Amen, <hi>with lifting up their Hands; and they bowed their Heads and worſhipped the Lord with their Faces to the ground.</hi> The publick Worſhip of our God, was never yet performed by any Primitive Church, without the outward humility of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the outward expreſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as well as with the inward devotion of the mind; Reaſon and Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and the conſtant practice of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31416:38"/>the People of God in all Ages, both in the Jewiſh, and the Chriſtian Church, is an undeniable Evidence to prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it. What means therefore the negligence, the prophaneneſs, the irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and unmannerly behaviour of ſome that are ſtiled Chriſtians? Is not the practice of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who could bow himſelf in the Houſe of <hi>Rimmon</hi> his falſe God, a reproach to us? Doth not the humility and the reſpect which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens conſtantly pay to their Divinities, upbraid the Clowniſhneſs of ſome of our Country-men? There are three Poſtures of Humility very decent in Prayer, and other parts of God's Worſhip, <hi>Standing, Kneeling,</hi> or <hi>Proſtration to the ground.</hi> When ever therefore we appear before God, either to pray to him, or to praiſe his holy Name, our Body muſt be in one of theſe poſtures, unleſs any natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental weakneſs or impediment may juſtly deſerve a diſpenſation: Likewiſe the lifting up of the Hands and Eyes unto Heaven, are expreſſions of Devotion, as ancient as the firſt People of God. Think not that the honour of your Blood, the excellency of your Perſons, or your emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent promotions, ought to excuſe you from this outward humility of the Body. God requires it at your hands in the 99th. <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the fifth Verſe. <hi>Exalt ye the

Haſt thou any reſpect for his Holy Name? Doſt thou look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as thy Creator, Protector, and Benefactor? Hath he received thee into his Church, and to the hopes of eternal Rewards? Is this Body of thine to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his heavenly Sanctuary, in all the Company of his Holy Angels, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and bow before him? Then prepare thy ſelf for this future and happy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Expreſs thy thanks for all his innumerable benefits, by thy Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Devotion to him as thy <hi>God,</hi> with the outward Humility of the Body, in all thy Addreſſes to his glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whether it be in publick or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; but chiefly in the publick Prayers of the Church. There not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our God, the Credit of our Profeſſion, the intereſt of our Brethren,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31416:39"/>whoſe Devotions are apt to grow cold by the ſight and ſenſe of our negligence; but your own Intereſt alſo as well as your Duty, calls you to this outward reſpect, for an unmannerly behaviour deſerves the Curſes, contrary to thoſe Bleſſings which we are there to beg of God: However, you can never expect in reaſon to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the Churches Prayers, if you will not vouchſafe ſo much as to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly concerned. O Chriſtians! let not any popular miſtakes, nor any Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prejudices rob you of the advantages which you might hope to obtain from God, by a devout, humble and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate attendance, at the offering up of the Excellent Prayers of our Church, for your good and happineſs. But if all theſe Reaſons cannot prevail upon ſome ſtiff, necked, and invincible Souls, ſo far as to cauſe them to be dutiful and humble in God's preſence at the hour of Prayer, let them conſider that in our civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the want or the omiſſion of a due reſpect is a diſgrace to the Perſon that ſhould render it, for it cauſeth Men to be branded with the odious Names of <hi>Clowns, Ill-bread, Brutiſh and uncivil People.</hi> Now they are the worſt of Clowns, that are ſo in Religion, that know not, or will not render the Hommage that is due from their Bodies to their God: If
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31416:39"/>therefore the reſpect that we have for him, is not able to oblige us to a Civil Behaviour, and decent Poſtures and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in Prayer; let the ſhame of Men, if we be not inſenſible to that likewiſe, cauſe us to behave our ſelves with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with reſpect in <hi>God</hi>'s preſence, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Men of Reaſon, and Chriſtians of good breeding and extraction, and not as Brute Beaſts that have neither man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners nor underſtanding. But of all Men, none are more engaged than ſuch as Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate publickly, and are the Mouths of their People, to offer up their Prayers with all the decency, humility, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Devotion, which might ſerve to excite the Auditors to a due reſpect; for as their Perſons are eyed by the whole Congregation, their Example is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out followers. It hath a great influence upon all that are preſent, either to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or diſcourage them in their publick Worſhip: Therefore in their diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful offering up of the Prayers of the Church, they are not only ſcandalous in their own Perſons, and guilty of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring <hi>God,</hi> diſgracing their Religion, profaning the publick Worſhip, but they are likewiſe guilty of all the contempt, negligence and unmannerly behaviour of their Attendants, if it happens through their ſhameful and irreverent Praying.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31416:40"/>Let therefore my Brethren of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſeriouſly conſider the apparent danger they are in, by an omiſſion of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I am perſwaded that our Nation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone had never fall'n into that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant humour, to loath the Godly Forms of Prayer, which all good Men, both at home and abroad highly eſteem, were it not for their diſreſpectful handling, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, whoſe Duty it is to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and grace them by their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Good things when they are delivered by a ſlovenly hand, are uſually rejected; and it is the weakneſs of the Common people, to value things not according to their true intrinſick worth, but according as they appear outwardly to their Senſes: A Prayer that ſhines with the gay cloaths of Wit and invention, and a good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſhall meet with acceptance, and draw many ſighs, and groans from an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Soul, tho' otherwiſe never ſo full of imperfections, when many will ſcarce afford an hearing to the ſolid and divine Prayers of the Church. How many in our late Days, have delighted to liſten to the unadviſed and blaſphemous Prayers of the Sons of Tumult and Diviſion? How many have ſpent their Days under the Pulpits of thoſe bloody Saints, without any diſcovery of wearineſs, whereas they now Complain of tediouſneſs, when in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31416:40"/>our ordinary Devotions we employ a few minutes to implore <hi>God</hi>'s divine Mercies, according to the moſt approved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious manner? How comes it to paſs that the extemporary productions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle and wicked Fancies, have been far more eſteemed amongſt many of us, than thoſe wiſe and excellent Prayers, compoſed in the beginning of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by ſuch as have ſealed the Proteſtant and Chriſtian Truths, with their Blood? Thoſe Prayers, I ſay, which are fitted to all Capacities, recommended to us by the Piety and Practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, Catholick, and Othodox Church, and which are not to be mended by any humane endeavours. This queſtion gives me an occaſion to ſpeak to thee my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, of ſome few particulars concerning Prayer, which the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions amongſt us render very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

This ſtrange attempt was reſerved for theſe laſt and worſt Ages of the World; and this kind of impiety which could never find enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment amongſt the Primitive Enemies of God, and of his Truth, hath been greedily embraced by ſome in theſe latter days, under the uſual deceiving pretence of purity and Religion, as if they alone were to be eſteemed Religious, who ſlander, condemn, blaſpheme, and contradict the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Practices of the reſt of Chriſtians,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31416:41"/>as if irregularity, and an affected ſigula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, were the beſt means to render them acceptable to God in his Worſhip. For that purpoſe we have ſeen them, to our great grief, caſt out of the Church, all the godly Forms of Prayer, which the Wiſdom and Piety of former Ages have recommended to us; and becauſe they could not ſpie in them any ſufficient cauſe to condemn and reject them, we have ſeen theſe over zealous brethren, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exclaim againſt all Forms, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, irreligious, and Popiſh, leaving every one to the irregular dictates of their Paſſion, and preſumptuous minds.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31416:42"/>becauſe that this calling upon the Name of the Lord, of theſe firſt Men of the ancient World, was performed in their publick meetings, wherein there was a Service and ordinary Worſhip, appointed and obſerved by the diſtinct reading of Prayers and Praiſes; which infer ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they had publick places appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perſons in whom the care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was entruſted, and a common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preſcribed to them in writing, which they were to read in the audience of the People. Further, it may be worthy of our Obſervation, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> when he ſpeaks of calling upon the Name of the Lord, in many of his Pſalms, he uſeth the ſame ſignificant word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as in that moſt remarkable Verſe of the 116 <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the 13 Verſe, where he ſpeaks of that Cup of Salvation, which was uſually taken by the <hi>Jews</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sacrifices, a Type of our Chriſtian <hi>Euchariſt, I will take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> This calling, ſignifies meeting together in the publick Worſhip of God, and offering to him, reading thoſe Forms of Prayers appointed by the Church: For it is the cuſtom of God's Holy Spirit, in relating the paſſages of former times, to allude by the expreſſion, to the manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe Actions that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31416:43"/>Thus <hi>David,</hi> in the 79th. <hi>Pſalm</hi> Verſe 6. deſires God to ſend down his <hi>Judgments, and pour out his Wrath upon the Heathen that have not known him, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon his Name;</hi> he makes uſe of the ſame word, <gap reason="foreign">

And in many other <hi>Pſalms, David</hi> uſeth the ſame Expreſſion, which imports a publick Aſſembly, and the reading of the Praiſes and Prayers in his Divine Worſhip, when he was wont to call upon God. This Obſervation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the conſtant Practice of all the Heathens, in the Worſhip of their Gods. Both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> had their conſtant Forms of Prayers and Praiſes, which yet are extant in the Writings of their Poets. It ſeems that they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this judicious and pious Cuſtom from the firſt Men of the World. And what God's People were accuſtomed to do to the Honour of the true God; theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did commonly practice the ſame in the ſervice of their falſe Gods, as may be obſerved by their Hymns, and other Ceremonies in their Worſhip.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:31416:43"/>
            <p>But this religious uſe of ſet Forms was in the Jewiſh Church, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the ſucceeding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as may be eaſily proved by the ſong of Triumph compoſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam, Exod.</hi> 15. after <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s overthrow in the Red-Sea;

That <hi>he ſet the Levites in the Houſe of the Lord, with Cymbals, with Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and with Harps, according to the Commandment of David, and of Gad the King's Seer, and Nathan the Prophet.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what is added in the next words, <hi>For ſo was the Commandment of the Lord by his Prophets.</hi> It ſeems in the Jewiſh Church, the obſerving of a preſcribed Form, was no Human inſtitution, but proceeded from God's Holy Spirit. And in the 30 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>that Hezekiah the King, and the Princes, commanded the Levites to ſing Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto the Lord, with the words of David, and of Aſaph the Seer.</hi> It was for that good purpoſe that <hi>David</hi> compos'd all his Divine Pſalms, that they might be of a conſtant uſe in the praiſing of, and the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31416:44"/>praying unto our great God. And after the <hi>Jews</hi> return from <hi>Babylon, Nehemiah</hi> commands the ſame uſe to be obſerved, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.45.46. And as it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to change theſe Forms, ſo likewiſe it may not be lawful for any, but ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as were inſpired of God, or were to take care of Religion,

But this uſe of Set Forms of Prayers and praiſing of God, is not Jewiſh, it is grounded upon ſuch ſolid and moral Reaſons, that have recommended it to the Chriſtian Church. St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in imitation of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> gives a Set Form of Prayer to his Diſciples. And Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to comply with the deſires of his Followers, teaches them a Set Form, oppoſite to the long and tedious Forms uſed by the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.1, 2. And not only in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but alſo in the receiving of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> Chriſt ſhews himſelf to be no Enemy of Forms, and Humane Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, when they tend to a Godly purpoſe, as may appear by the ſinging of the Hymn after the Celebration, and by the poſture of leaning. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in imitation of his great Maſter, commands <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>That
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31416:44"/>Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thanks, be made for all men.</hi> That is, that he ſhould appoint in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his Dioceſs, ſuch Set Forms of Prayer, as might be offered up to God, <hi>For Kings, and for all that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we may lead a quiet and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> That this was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may appear by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Chriſtian Churches in the next Age to the Apoſtles; for in the Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fathers, we read of the Set Forms of Prayer,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Conc.</hi> Laodicea, <hi>can.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Miletan. Con. can.</hi> 2.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in God's Publick Worſhip. And we have yet extant ſome of thoſe Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Liturgies of the People of <hi>God,</hi> differing in many things; for the Wiſdom of <hi>God</hi>'s Holy Spirit hath left the Compoſure of theſe Prayers, to the Rulers of the diſtinct Churches, that they ſhould appoint ſuch Forms as were moſt agreeable with the Tempers and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their People, ſuch as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Devotion and Piety, and ſerve beſt for the Promotion of <hi>God</hi>'s Glory.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in theſe later Days, ſince the beginning of the Reformation, all the Churches of our Brethren beyond the Seas, have their Set Forms of Prayer,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31416:45"/>from which it is not lawful to vary, and which are appointed by the authority of their Rulers. Never any attempted the changing of them, their People never mutined againſt them, or againſt Forms in general. Never any perſon was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in publick, to prefer his own Fancies to theſe Prayers commanded to be uſed in the Church: But in the Churches of every Nation, there is a conſtant and an univerſal Uniformity in the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our God. And this good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is Religiouſly kept without any fear of Superſtition. This Univerſal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Ages, Churches, and Nations, that have inſtituted, and conſtantly uſed Set Forms of Prayer in <hi>God</hi>'s Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, is ſufficient to juſtifie the Religious Orders of our Church, from all ſcandalous aſperſions of our miſtaken Brethren.</p>
            <p>But Reaſon and Religion, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of Chriſtian Societies, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this Practice and Uſe to us as well as to them: I ſuppoſe no perſon can deny, but ſet Forms are abſolutely neceſſary for the information, inſtruction, and benefit of the more ignorant and younger ſort, who muſt be taught how to ask their Conveniencies from <hi>God</hi>'s Bounty, and in what Name to make their Addreſſes to his Divine Majeſty, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31416:45"/>this information from Men, we find them not in a Capacity to pray and ſpeak to God, as they ſhould, unleſs they be inſpired from above, which is not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual: To remedy their ignorance and weakneſs, the Church of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands conſtantly the uſe of Set Forms of Prayer in publick; that by a frequent repetition, we might imprint them in the memories of Perſons not able to read, and that otherwiſe have no means to learn them. Therefore generally to diſcourage or condemn the uſe of Set Forms of Prayer, is to deprive a great part of Chriſtianity, from the comfort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of praying to God; and it is to diſcover an Enmity againſt Religion, which no good Diſciple of Chriſt can poſſibly harbour. I could here ſhew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny horrid inconveniencies that would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen amongſt us, had we no Set Forms of Prayer, but for brevity ſake, I omit the mention of them, for I conceive it is not ſo much at Set Forms of Prayer, that our Zealots quarrel, as it is at their publick uſe in <hi>God</hi>'s Divine Worſhip, and the excluſion of all others of their own, or other Mens Fabrick, at ſuch ſolemn times and occaſions: But let Mens abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and gifts of Prayer be never ſo ſignal and extrordinary, I dare affirm, and can eaſily prove by Scripture and Reaſon, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31416:46"/>they are not to be allowed to cauſe their own Inventions to juſtle out the uſual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church. That Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are to be preferred, whether they be declared <hi>memoriter,</hi> or read in a Book, to all the moſt excellent extemporary ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Prayers; and that conſtant and ſetled Forms, in a well governed Church, are agreeable with the Word of God, and the common good. Were there no other reaſon to recommend them, but that decency which St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Chriſt's Church, in all its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Practices and Divine Worſhip; it would be ſufficient to make us embrace an Uniformity both in manner, as well as matter; for how ridiculous would a Nation appear to all unbyaſſed Souls, if there were no order; if every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould be differing in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if one Miniſter ſhould read when the other ſings; if one ſhould ſpend the Sabbath in ſpeaking, and another in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or if one ſhould pray for one thing, another for the contrary; or if the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were diſcrepant; if one Miniſter ſhould pray in one manner; others follow the dictates of a Rubrick of another make; what a wide Gate would this deformity open to all kind of Errors, Hereſies and Blaſphemies? And how ridiculous ſhould we appear to all Foreign Churches? We
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31416:46"/>have already experienced ſufficiently the danger of this general liberty allowed to all Men, to pray what they liſt in the Ears of the People. For, not to mention the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies that ſome have been guilty of; the Whimſies and Blaſphemies that they have bolted forth; the Devil hath made uſe of this Engine to overthrow the Faith of many ſilly Souls, by inſinuating the moſt dangerous and damnable Errors with the gift of praying <hi>extempore.</hi> In the late unnatural Rebellion, Men took occaſion in their extemporary Prayers, to vent, not only the moſt pernicious miſtakes, but alſo diſobedience to the Civil Magiſtrate; and from the Pulpit have poiſoned many, to our ſorrow, with moſt horrid and Anti-Chriſtian Principles, which to this day no Reaſon nor Remedy can cure.</p>
            <p>But if no ſuch danger were to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from extemporary praying, if all Men ſo employed had the Integrity to intend it only to God's Glory, and the publick quiet; yet ſuch Prayers cannot have that mature conſideration, nor thoſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious expreſſions as a well Meditated Prayer, judiciouſly compoſed and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And doth it become the reſpect we owe to ſo wiſe a God, to be ſo bold as to preſent unto him any thing that comes firſt upon the Lips, the haſty productions of our unadviſed Fancies, or the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31416:47"/>expreſſions of our minds, without conſidering before, whether the things we petition for, and the manner of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be acceptable to him, and agreeable with his revealed Will and Word? And in regard we are ſo apt to miſtake, and are ſo full of infirmities; does it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Chriſtian diſcretion, to weigh, and ſeriouſly to examine, what we are to ſay to ſo Wiſe and Divine a Majeſty? that our weakneſſes might not hinder the effects of our Prayers, eſpecially in a publick Congregation, where our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes may have many ill conſequences, where not only God and our ſelves are concerned, but alſo many of divers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Capacities and Eſtates, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digencies we repreſent to a merciful God? Now if Forms of Prayer are to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſed, let any Man of Reaſon judge impartially, which are the moſt proper, our own or the Churches? the fond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of our private Imaginations, or the judicious Prayers compoſed by the grave Rulers of our Chriſtian Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? I doubt not but ſeveral have had, and yet have an extraordinary Gift in Praying, to move and ſtir up the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their Hearers. This Gift therefore which proceeds from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, for the benefit of the Church, requires that we ſhould ſuffer it to perform
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31416:47"/>that good which is thereby intended. This may be done on certain occaſions and times, and immediately before the Sermon. And I ſuppoſe that no moderate Chriſtian will then prohibit ſuch gifted perſons, to employ that ability which they have received from God for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the publick; if they make uſe of it diſcreetly, judiciouſly, and ſoberly, without affectation or vain glory, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation. But there is no allowance therefore to be given to the pride and vanity of others, to prefer the fond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures of their indiſcreet Fancies to the pious and regular Prayers of the Church. And it may be juſtly feared in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that voluntary and new Prayers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with vehemency, may cauſe ignorant and fooliſh Men, who are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary with the ordinary Devotions, to diſeſteem, ſlight and neglect them, and to be continually craving thoſe extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Ejaculations of gifted Men, and that from perſons inſufficient; who may be thereby tempted to gratifie the others humour to their own and the publick hurt. However the gift of praying is not hindred by our publick Forms, from performing the benefit which is thereby intended; but fooliſh Men are thereby reſtrained from thoſe miſchiefs which they might bring upon themſelves and others,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31416:48"/>by ſo great a Liberty as they have had during our Anarchy.</p>
            <p>Moreover as it ſhould be the intent of all Humane Conſtitutions in every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to aim directly at the general good of all, and ſpecially in the Church, to aim at the Benefit and Comfort of the weakeſt and dulleſt capacities, as well as of the quickeſt apprehenſions; ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers ought to be received, which ſute with the meaneſt abilities. Now I dare affirm, that theſe extemporary Prayers are not of that nature. They may be ſo happy to pleaſe the Corrupt Humour of the Hearer with the novelty of the invention, with the vehemency of the expreſſion, with the pleaſantneſs of the affected Tone; but they are not ſo fit to be publickly offered up to God, as the known, approved and ordinary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, and are not able to prevail ſo much upon our affections, were we but inwardly moved with a right zeal for God's Glory: Neither can we ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to ſuch ſudden Prayers, proceeding from theſe gifted Men, as to thoſe with which we are perfectly well acquainted, and which we know to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with God's will; for in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we have need at every expreſſion to make a judicious reflection whether what is ſaid is true or falſe, right or wrong,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31416:48"/>before we can heartily ſubſcribe to ſuch Prayers; whereas there is no ſuch need in the Publick Prayers of the Church, which we underſtand before: There we have nothing elſe to do, but to ſtir up the affections of our Souls, that we may join unanimouſly together, and offer them up to God. Therefore the gift of extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary praying, is not of ſuch uſe, and carries not with it that real Benefit which ſome lightly imagine; I am certain that perſons of a weak and ſlow apprehenſion, are not ſo able and apt to receive benefit from them as from the known Prayers of the Church. The unuſual expreſſions of other new Prayers, may be better able to move their Fancy, but they are not ſo able to ſtir up the affections of ſuch as bring an unprejudiced mind, and that look more upon the things, than the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing; for other dainty Ears, and of a quicker apprehenſion, it may be that a new and eloquent Prayer may be more acceptable and more beneficial than to the duller ſort; but it requires from them a greater Labour and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Motion and Activity of the Soul, as well as an extraordinary ability to joyn in ſuch Prayers. And for the perſons that utter them, if they be <hi>extempore,</hi> without any premeditation, and of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I dare affirm, that they are full of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31416:49"/>imperfections and confuſion in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and that the perſons that ſpeak them, are far from the diſpoſition needful in Prayer. Whilſt their Hands and their Eyes are lifted up, their Souls and its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are employed in ſeeking for fit words to declare the conceptions of the mind; and in the mean time it thinks not of, and is not able, as it ſhould, to call upon God, and concern its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the Requeſts that are preſented to him. For ſudden Ejaculations and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the Soul and Mind to God, the ſame reaſon holds not, becauſe there is not the ſame order, contrivance and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul required. For theſe and other cauſes, Set Forms either before us in a Book, or recorded in our Memories, which may as ſuddenly ſupply us with the Words and matter, are the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of praying to God, chiefly in his Publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>But if we have any regard to God our merciful Creator, I think there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo ſimple as to imagine that the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of the Tongue, or unuſual expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, can have a greater influence upon him, than the Common Prayers of the Church. It is not the Tongue but the Heart that God Eyes in all our Services. The whiſperings and private Complaints of the one are heard, when the loud
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31416:49"/>Cries of the other are rejected. The Door of Mercy flies open at the beatings of a devout Heart, when it remains bolted at the furious aſſaults of the moſt eloquent Tongue. Therefore as it ſhould be our chief regard in Prayer, to examine that which is moſt pleaſing to God, not that which gratifies our own Humour: We ſhould chuſe thoſe Prayers to offer up to him, wherein our Hearts may be as well concerned as our Tongues. In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as the Set Forms of Prayer are the greateſt helps that we can procure, both to the learned and the unlearned, to the wiſe and the ignorant, I ſee no reaſon wherefore Men ſhould be deprived of them, and extemporary Prayers ſet up. Thoſe Forms I mean, where things are ſpoken, and not only words; where the Conceptions are plainly expreſſed, and the Prayers fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the uſe of the weakeſt Capacities. They can never be too plain, nor too eaſie; and the Wiſe and the Learned ought not to think it a trouble to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend in their Publick Worſhip, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts worded in a manner anſwerable to the meaneſt abilities; for Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires from them an Union with the weakeſt of their Brethren, who is in as great a likelihood of God's mercy, and obtaining God's Glory, as perſons of the greateſt Reach and Judgment.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:31416:50"/>
            <p>I know, that it is the common uſe of our Diſſenting Brethren, to upbraid us in our Devotions, with too much Formality, in regard of our being ſo fond of Set Forms, with an excluſion of all new compoſed Prayers. I heartily wiſh that we our ſelves, the Clergy and the People, did not give cauſe for this aſperſion; but that it may not deceive the ignorant with its firſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance, let me tell them, that we are not guilty of Formality, nor to be condemned for it, becauſe that we uſe ſet and preſcribed Forms, but becauſe we uſe them not right, with that Devotion, Reſpect, Humility, and inward Affection, as becomes Chriſtians and Petitioners of the God of Heaven: Becauſe in our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, we repeat only the Words, and mind not the uttering them with the affections of the Soul; becauſe ſome make it only a trade to go to Prayer, others run them over as a Task, and too many mind the Form, but few mind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Prayer; that is, to expreſs and offer them up to God with thoſe inward qualifications and outward humility, that I have now recommended to the practice of our Chriſtian Brethren. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to paſs to the ſecond particular, that I have promiſed to examine. The cauſes of the Peoples Contempt of our Liturgy, and their neglect of the Forms
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31416:50"/>of Prayer, enjoined in our Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could name a great many Cauſes that we our ſelves give; but I ſhall reduce them all, for brevity ſake, to theſe ſix follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I muſt accuſe the Clergy, both high and low, great and ſmall, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the greateſt cauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our Liturgy and Rubrick, by their indifferent Practices: By their over haſty reading of them, and by their omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that reſpect which they ſhould out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly expreſs, and that devotion which is due to God; they give occaſion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to ſlight the very Prayers themſelves. As they are the Peoples mouths to God, they ſhould be the Peoples Examples and Patterns, to ſhew them how to beg God's Mercies, as well as to endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them for their relief. And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er care they ſhould take to obſerve all the motions of reverence, becauſe their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice hath ſo great an influence upon the Congregation, and is of ſo great a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that they oblige Men to eſteem thoſe Prayers that are offered up to God. For this reaſon, a perſon that officiates in the audience of a Congregation, ſhould read over the Prayers, not as we peruſe a Story in a Book, but with his Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, and upon his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31416:51"/>knees; he ought to pronounce the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as if he were ſpeaking to God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, viſibly preſent, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them with the moſt apparent ſigns of ſincerity, of reverence and earneſtneſs imaginable: Endeavour to grace the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayers of the Church, with thy grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and comely delivery, with thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and reſpectful poſtures and geſtures, and let the Eyes of the Aſſembly learn from thee, my reverend Brother, the manner how to pray, as well as the words and expreſſions of Prayer; O! let not the negligence and ſloathfulneſs of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be laid to thy charge, but ſtrive to be zealouſly affected thy ſelf, that this diſpoſition may be communicated to thy hearers. I ſpeak to you chiefly, whoſe office and happineſs it is, to ſing daily praiſes to God, in Cathedral Churches. Think not that you have ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged your Duty, if you have obſerved your diſtances, your tunes, and pleaſed the Auditors with your melodious Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: O! Remember, my Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou muſt likewiſe pleaſe thy God with the harmony of the Soul, and tune as well his praiſes with the inward affections, as well as with the outward concerts of Muſick. Take heed leſt thy behaviour, or thy negligent diſcharge of thy Duty, give ſcandal to our diſſenting
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31416:51"/>Brethren, who are too apt to be offended at the leaſt ſign of weakneſs, which thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcover at ſuch a time.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another cauſe of the contempt of our Liturgy, given by the Clergy, is the negligence of the Superior and wealthieſt Clergy, who ſeldom read the Prayers of the Church themſelves, unleſs it be ſome ſmall portion, but commonly employ their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, or the meaneſt perſons of the Church, to offer up thoſe Prayers that are of the greateſt concernment to us, and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Rubrick. As if that Office were too mean for their Promotions and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereas it is the moſt glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that we Men can pretend to: It makes us like our divine and great Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who intercedes for us in the preſence of God, and offers up our Requeſts. Is there any that nameth himſelf a Chriſtian, that ſcorns to imitate the Author of our Salvation, and to offer up the Prayers of their Congregations to God? No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be too worthy for ſo excellent an Employment; and becauſe the uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod obſerved in Cathedrals, cannot well be changed; I could wiſh that the Superior Clergy, the Biſhop, the Dean, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, would ſometimes perform thoſe parts of Devotion, which they have totally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the meaneſt of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Society; that thereby they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31416:52"/>might remove from the minds of Men, the diſeſteem of our Prayers, which they are apt to conceive and entertain thereby. For as in the Days of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> Men took occaſion to contemn Religion it ſelf, when he had made the loweſt of his People, the Prieſts of his High Places, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Religion; ſo likewiſe in our time, Men, eſpecially our Enemies, are more inclinable to deſpiſe our excellent Prayers, becauſe they are moſt employed to offer them up to God in the name of the People, who are in a mean ſtation in the Church, and have but ſorrowful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I muſt not forget another cauſe of the Peoples deſpiſing our Godly Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which many Miniſters who are too highly conceited of their parts do give. 'Tis in mangling, cutting ſhort, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the Prayers of the Church, to make more room for the delivery of their own proud conceptions, either in Prayer or a Sermon, contrary to the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of our Superiors; for by this action they declare openly their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect of the Forms of Prayer, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to uſe them, that they are thereunto meerly compelled, and their too high eſteem of their own inventions. And when the People ſee them haſten them over ſo ſpeedily, they are wont to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31416:52"/>be prejudiced with ſtrange conceits of theſe excellent Prayers, or at leaſt, not to eſteem nor uſe them as they ought. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe my Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, not to ſhorten the publick Prayers, but carefully, diligently, and conſtantly to obſerve the Rules commanded; and which they are the more engaged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, becauſe their diſobedience is apt to encourage and foment the Peoples diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of theſe Prayers, which they might uſe with ſo much advantage to their Souls, had they that affection for them which they really deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The publick behavior of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility, Gentry, and perſons whoſe Examples are regarded, is another cauſe of the Peoples diſeſteem of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. When Men of Learning, of Wealth, and of Honour, aſſiſt at the Devotions of their Brethren, without expreſſing any reſpect for them, and without bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part in the Service of the Church, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are diſcouraged from the uſe of it. This we ſee almoſt in every Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome of the Chief are commonly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſted at ſome part of our praying or praiſing of God, in which, they will ſhew no ſign of devotion; or it may be, the Gentlemen of the Pariſh are not ſo religious as they ſhould be, therefore they think it ſufficient for them, if they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31416:53"/>bring their Bodies to the Publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though they remain there in God's preſence, as ſo many Stocks or Brutes, without expreſſing any Devotion for the Prayers, or any Worſhip to their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. If theſe ſeaſonable lines ſhall happen to fall into the hands of any of you, whoſe Nobility and Extraction deſerves the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the reſt of the Nation; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how highly you your ſelves would be offended, if your Servants and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſhould appear before you, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your aſſiſtance in their wants, with as much diſreſpect as you appear before the God of Heaven, unto whom you are but Tenants for life, or it may be for a ſhorter time. Would you be ready to reward their contempt of your perſon, with the grant of their deſires? Would not you be ready to check their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and ſaucineſs, if they ſhould treat you as they do their Labourers? And what think you, my Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of your diſreſpectful and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous approaches before God, your great Creator? Do not you ſtand in need of his aſſiſtance and bleſſings? And if you do, is this the means to obtain it, to ſlight thoſe Prayers which are preſented to God for the increaſe of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſperity? For your own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, be not the greateſt Clowns of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31416:53"/>your Congregation in God's preſence; but as you excel the reſt in Nobility of Blood, endeavour to excel them alſo in your reſpects to God, in your zeal and devotion to him; render to him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your Bodies, that homage which he claims and deſerves from you for all his favours. Intereſs your ſelves in our praiſing of his holy Name, and in our Prayers to him. Employ the credit of your Eſtates and Promotions which God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath given you to promote his Glory and Worſhip. Why ſhould you be ſo unthankful to his goodneſs, to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, to his Profeſſion, and not to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him who hath beſtowed ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon your perſons? O! Remember that the higher you are exalted above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, the lower you are ingaged to ſtoop to this good God, chiefly in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in his Worſhip before the Eyes of the World, ſeeing that your neglect in this caſe, will not be only injurious to him, but diſgraceful to your noble perſons, and prejudicial to all the aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Moreover the ſlanders, the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy jeſtings, and the irreligious paſtimes of prophane Perſons, in theſe laſt corrupt days, upon the Book of Common-Prayer, have ſtrangely filled many minds (religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed) with ſtrong prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: And when they have ſeen the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31416:54"/>the greateſt pretenders to Religion, with the Authorty of the Nation, paſs a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation upon theſe Forms of Prayer, as well as the prophaner ſort; when they yet ſee many Wiſe, Godly and Conſcientious Men, ſtand ſtifly in opoſition to their reception, the weaker ſort of Men, that commonly judge of things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the general Vote, are ready to look upon them as ſuperſtitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. The ſchiſmatical ſcrupuloſity of the one, and the wicked Blaſphemies of the other, have diſcredited this excellent Book, among ſuch as are not wont to examine the true worth of things; for the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort, it is too well known, that there is nothing ſo ſacred or holy, but they have offered Violence to it. God and his Sacraments, his Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Chriſt and our Redemption, Heaven and Hell, our preſent Enjoyments and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hopes, are all turned into Ridicule by thoſe monſtrous Wits, whoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Faith is limited by their Senſes. No wonder therefore, if they continue to abuſe the conſtant Prayers and Service of the Church. But certainly the Religion of thoſe perſons is not well grounded, when they are to be ſcoffed out of it; and their belief is not well ſetled, if every prophane jeſt can oblige them to call it in queſtion. If we may be perſwaded by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31416:54"/>theſe frothy wits to change our religious Cuſtoms, Ceremonies and Prayers, we ſhall quickly become as wicked as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and baniſh Religion it ſelf out of the Land. They are no competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of our Devotions who were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, but rather their malicious expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould confirm Men of diſcretion, in their eſteem of thoſe pious things which they condemn, becauſe they were never inclinable to Piety, and their Tempers are repugnant to it, and to thoſe Godly Rules that reproach them for their licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Let theſe conſiderations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrengthen the weakneſs of ſuch as are apt to be thereby perſwaded to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction of theſe Godly Forms.</p>
            <p>And for the other Enemies of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, their Converſations ſeem to inſinuate the equity of their Judgments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are perſons of a religious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and good manners; their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices therefore againſt our Rubrick, are more dangerous. But if a judicious and pious Soul would take the pains to ſift them out, and examine the Cauſes of their invincible prejudices, they ſhall either find none, or ſuch ſlender ones as may cauſe us to wonder at their ſtiffneckedneſs and ſtrange fancies. Such, I am ſure, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them moſt ridiculous to all foreign Churches of Chriſt. Their moſt ordinary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31416:55"/>and popular Complaint is, that it is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and taken out of the Maſs-Book. An Error which any Man will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if he will but compare our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the Popiſh Prayers of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of <hi>Rome.</hi> Can that be Popiſh which oppoſeth all the Errors and miſtakes of the Papiſts? which teacheth us to pray for God's aſſiſtance and direction againſt all the Hereſies, Plots and Conſpiracies of the <hi>Pope?</hi> which was in uſe in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, before ever there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Anti-Chriſtian <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi> Can that be reckoned to be Popiſh which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Revelations of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with the Doctrines and belief of the beſt Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, and which their moſt Orthodox Divines Embrace as moſt conſonant with their Faith and Piety? The Creed, the ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer, may with as much likelihood be ſaid to be Popiſh, or to be taken out of the Maſs-Book, becauſe the Papiſts have them in their <hi>Breviarium.</hi> To all unprejudiced perſons this accuſation appears a meer Calumny, unleſs any of thoſe refined Souls could ſpy out, and ſhew us any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the Common-Prayer which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errors, and tends to promote the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Intereſt amongſt us. But it is the uſual practice of abuſive
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31416:55"/>tongues, when they cannot inſtance any certain Crime, to bring their accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in groſs, that their malice may be leſs diſcernable, and their charge may be more weighty. But let not the vain and groundleſs conceits of Popery and Superſtition deter thee, my Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from making uſe, with Comfort to thy Soul, of theſe Godly Prayers. Let not theſe miſtaken Brethren infect thy judgment with the ſame troubleſom Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Examin and try, ſearch into every Corner of this Book, and ſee whether thou canſt find any colour of Popery; that is to ſay, any ſign of thoſe Errors which are in Controverſie between us and the Papiſts. Let not their impoſtures prevail ſo much upon thy diſcretion, as to cauſe thee to take for Popery, what is agreeable with Chriſt's true Religion and Doctrines. It hath always been the glory of our Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, of all other Churches, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, Government, and Practices of the Primitive and firſt Churches of Chriſt. Therefore in this of the Liturgy, our Church recommends that manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is moſt like that of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and which is moſt anſwerable to our Government and condition; as our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr, and our late Soveraign of Bleſſed Memory, declares in vindication
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31416:56"/>of the Prayers of the Church in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Book.</p>
            <p>All other accuſations as well as this, ſavour more of malice and diſpleaſure, than right Reaſon, and tend to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious end, to aboliſh Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in Prayer, and to introduce a ſad and unreaſonable Confuſion in our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God. Let therefore every good Chriſtian take heed, if he himſelf hath ſuch an invincible prejudice againſt theſe Forms enjoyned in our Church, that he cannot uſe them himſelf with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Comfort to his Soul, that he diſturb not others minds with the ſame Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical miſtakes, and ſpread not abroad what I could wiſh were conſined to the bottomleſs Pit. Let him not hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the Benefit which they may reap from a hearty and zealous Offering up of theſe Prayers to God. Abſtain, my Chriſtian Brother, from Blaſpheming that which thou doſt not perfectly underſtand, or that which thou hateſt without a juſt cauſe. Draw not others into the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and be not uncharitable, to think our Devotions not acceptable to our good God, becauſe thou haſt an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable diſpleaſure againſt them. Think not that Piety is confined to thy Breaſt alone, and to thoſe of thy Sect. Lay aſide, I beſeech thee, that bitterneſs, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31416:56"/>peeviſhneſs and froward temper which makes thee fret at our good Order, and Chriſtian Diſcipline: If thou perceiveſt any faults, coldneſs, dulneſs, or unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Actions in private perſons, charge not their miſcarriages upon our Church, or Rubrick; but be ſo reaſonable, not to proclaim thine unreaſonable diſtaſtes, to the prejudice of others and thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I cannot forget to mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cauſe of Mens contempt of our Forms and Rubrick, which is, That they are brought up in the ignorance of that manner of preſenting them to God, which might cauſe them to meet with true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and real benefit. For I know ſome that have conſtantly attended at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers of the Church, and have for many years ſcarce omitted any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that did invite them; yet becauſe they knew not how to uſe them as they ſhould, they have not at any time found that inward content which they now think to receive from new Modes of Prayer; and at laſt have totally forſaken them, crying out moſt bitterly againſt their former Formality, luke-warmneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in Prayer. As if that unfit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proceeded from the Prayers, and not from the ignorance of their minds, which when it is ſtrengthened by prejudice, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, or Intereſt, is the greateſt cauſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31416:57"/>of their diſſatisfaction at our Prayers uſed in the Church; and that which deprives them of the advantages which they might receive from them. This Ignorance is the greateſt Enemy of our Liturgy, and of our publick peace; which if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be willing to expel, for his own, and the Churches benefit, let him ſeriouſly conſider, and make uſe of theſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will ſhew him how to offer up our Prayers with comfort to his Soul.</p>
            <p>I have already ſet down general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to pray well, which every good Chriſtian ought to learn to practice in all Prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God;
<note place="margin">Third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</note> but beſides thoſe which ſute with all tempers and ſorts of Men, I ſuppoſe that ſome advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſides may be given more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and more proper for thoſe perſons amongſt us that are diſſatisfied with our Prayers and Liturgy, and prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Some advices, I mean, that may have a ſpecial regard to their cauſeleſs miſtakes and the Prayers of the Church. And truly I judge many ſtand in great need of theſe directions, who are well skilled in other kinds of Devotion; for prejudice here ſuffers them not to learn, or at leaſt not to practice what their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection teaches them in other Caſes to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31416:57"/>perform without a Teacher; if we may have the Charity to believe what they affirm, That they are truly and zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected in the Prayers which are of their Miniſters Compoſure, and that they can joyn their hearts in Devotion with them; for I very much queſtion whether thoſe perſons that ſeem outwardly to be ſo diſpoſed, are really ſo in their hearts, and whilſt they are, or may be delighted with the Prayer, whether their Souls are truly in a praying temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Endeavour to be heartily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the Godly Forms of Prayer recommended in our Church, employ Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience to perſwade thy ſelf, my Chriſtian Brother, to embrace what Duty commands, that Duty which thou oweſt to Authority, and thy intereſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges thee to practice: Why ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice keep thee always blindfolded? Why ſhould Men of perverſe judgments and corrupt deſigns, impoſe upon thy judgment ſuch groſs miſtakes? Why wilt thou dote upon thine own Errors, and entertain them with ſo much ſtiffneſs, as if thy Salvation did thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; thoſe Errors I mean, that cauſe thee to look upon our Prayers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions as ſuperſtitious, and make ſo great a breach in the Church where we live? Make it thy buſineſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31416:58"/>the true ground of thine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſpleaſures at our Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Take not things of that high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon truſt, and captivate not thy diſcretion to the judgment of others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo learned, but with the aſſiſtance of Reaſon, and holy Scripture rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, labour to lift out the Truth. To theſe and ſuch like endeavours, make uſe of Prayer to the God of peace, that he may expel and drive away all the Miſts of Error, which keep thee at a diſtance from our manner of worſhipping our great God. Conſider the neceſſity of thoſe things that are therein deſired, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of their firſt Compoſers, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of foreign Reformed Churches, the Commands and Injunctions of the wiſe Governours of the Church and State, who have no other intent, in all their Laws relating to this purpoſe, but thy Salvation and the publick Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity. Is it poſſible that thou excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them in diſcretion and judgment, and that they are all miſtaken in the good end which they purpoſe to themſelves? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this reconcilement, 'tis not poſſible for thee to receive any benefit from our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by joyning with us, for thy Soul will never offer up heartily to God that for which it hath a ſtrong averſion.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:31416:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Overcome in thy Soul all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpleaſure which thou haſt concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt the Perſon of thy Miniſter officiating, or diſtaſtes at his behaviour and actions. What if he be openly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, or at variance with thee; Let not his guiltineſs cauſe thee to be guilty of irregularity, or neglecting thy Duty to God, and the intereſt of thy Soul. Let not your mutual diſſatisfaction cauſe you to be diſſatisfied with God and his Worſhip. Such Wicked Varlets as <hi>Hoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> are too apt to cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſlight the Offerings of the Lord; but they are not therefore excuſable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who requires an obedience to his Laws, from every diſtinct perſon, and allows not the vitiouſneſs of the one to be pleaded for the diſorderly behaviour of the other.</p>
            <p>But certain it is, that whilſt thou art inwardly diſpleaſed with thy Miniſter, thou canſt never conjoyn thine heart with the Godly Prayers which proceed out of his mouth; whilſt thou art offended with his perſon, his Prayers and his Words will never benefit thee much. I ſhall not examine the many frivolous cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes, which the Men of our days enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the Clergy; but this I dare affirm, That it is both the Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Pariſhioner to ſmother his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31416:59"/>anger and diſpleaſure conceived againſt his Miniſter, ſpecially at the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when he is drawing near to God in Prayer, if he will be in a poſſibility of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right. Look not on him at that time as thine Enemy, but as thy Friend, who prays for thy neceſſities as well as his own; look not on him as one at a diſtance from thee, but reconciled in the common Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion. God forbid that the uſual differences of Men about Worldly Intereſts, ſhould ſeparate us in God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from one another, and cauſe our variances to be eternal. If therefore we are likely, notwithſtanding our preſent debates, to meet unanimouſly to worſhip God's Majeſty for all Eternity, and ſing to him angelical Halelujahs hereafter, why may we not now ſuppreſs our diſpleaſures, ſtifle our paſſions, and reconcile our ſelves in the Worſhip of our great Creator and common Benefactor? For that intent it concerns thee not to mind ſo much the Perſon, as the Petitions, not ſo much the Miniſter as God, for whoſe ſake, and at whoſe command thou art ready to forget the moſt ſenſible wrongs, and check the ſtrongeſt paſſions of hatred and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Think not that the vitious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of any in the Congregation, will be a prejudice to thy Prayers, or hinder
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31416:59"/>their accptance. It is the common excuſe of Men that are willing to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Duties of Religion, That in our publick Aſſemblies all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are promiſcuouſly admitted, and that they cannot join in Prayers with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly debauched, or with perſons that are known to be ſcandalous. But this vain pretence proceeds many times from a proud conceit of our own Sanctity, and favours of the Phariſees temper in the Goſpel, who had ſo much of impudence in his Prayer to God, that the Publican's Humility was preferred before him. God that ſees all our actions and tempers, knows how to put a diſterence between thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious behaviour, and the Vices of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian. 'Tis not thy Neighbour's ungodlineſs that can prejudice thy Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Why ſhouldeſt thou be offended with that which God allows; and the publick Unity and Peace of the Church requires? We could wiſh that in our publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies all were Saints and Angels; but ſeeing that is not to be expected, to cull and pick out every vitious perſon, or ſuch as may be thought to be ſo by ſome ill-willers, I am afraid ſcarce any would be left. We muſt therefore bear with that which is not to be avoided, and take heed that we diſturb not the publick qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et more than the vitious and the profane,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31416:60"/>by our indiſcreet and Schiſmatical niceties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou wilt offer up the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church with benefit to thy Soul, and with the affections of thy Heart, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve the motions of the Body en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in the Common-Prayer; who knows but that this ſubmiſſion, and this cuſtom will have a ſpeedy influence upon thy mind to cauſe thy Soul to join in the ſame reſpects to God. Certain it is, that the nearneſs of Relation between them, will beget a mutual compliance between the actions of the one and the affections of the other, ſo that the often practiſing of things muſt needs reconcile us to thoſe performances, and remove the ſtrongeſt prejudices that are not grounded in reaſon, nor ſtrengthened by divine Revelation. If therefore any weak Brother cannot at preſent comply with the Devotions of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if he finds an inward repugnancy for the publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which hinders him from receiving the comfort and benefit thereby intended, let him follow and try my advice but a few Months. Let him force his Body to obſerve all the motions of Reſpect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Rubrick. Let him ſtand up when we give glory to God, and ſing forth his praiſes. Let him kneel in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and outwardly obſerve a due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and he ſhall find that his former
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:31416:60"/>averſion will inſenſibly wear away, and by degrees he will bring his Soul to a hearty and religious compliance with thoſe godly Forms of Prayer, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could never uſe with any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his mind; he ſhall find his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy humour of diſcontent evaporate it ſelf, and his Body draw after the Soul and its faculties, to a ſincere worſhipping of our good God, in the manner that is practiſed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To uſe the Prayers of the Church with that devotion that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a frequent meditation upon them is very requiſite. A Meditation, I mean, upon the neceſſity of thoſe things that are there deſired; upon the advantage of Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Unity in God's divine Worſhip; upon their agreeableneſs with holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, its Doctrines and Expreſſions; upon the expreſs Commands of the King and the wiſe Councils of our Nation, under four or five Kings ſucceſſively, who una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly enjoin the uſe of theſe Prayers in the publick Worſhip of God; upon the decency and reaſonableneſs of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Order, and manner of our Service; upon the frivolouſneſs and Folly of all Objections againſt it; upon the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and invincible hatred of all Objections. A meditation alſo is requiſite to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, upon ſeveral matters ſuitable to theſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31416:61"/>godly Forms of Prayer. Such Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I mean, as may elevate the Soul to prepare and diſpoſe it for a Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and inflame our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in order to a more zealous offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the publick Prayers of the Church to the Divine Majeſty. Beſides, to perſwade the judgment and remove all miſtakes, I recommend to thee the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a <hi>Rationale</hi> upon the Common-Prayer; that if by any means thou mayeſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to a religious and devout confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in publick to the Order of our Church.</p>
            <p>But all this while methinks I hear a ſort of Zealots amongſt us, Extol and Cry up <hi>the Praying by the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi>
               </note> and that in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the reading of the Forms preſcribed by the Church. I muſt ſpeak a word to rectifie their miſtakes, and to prevent the miſchiefs which are thereby intended. For this good purpoſe I ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> examine what <hi>Praying by the Spirit</hi> is, in the ſenſe of St. <hi>Paul. Secondly,</hi> I ſhall prove that for the moſt part, in all Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary fluencies of Prayer, though they be the gifts of the Spirit, ſuch perſons as uſe them at that very inſtant, can ſcarce be ſaid to pray in the Spirit. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall plainly demonſtrate, that the eaſieſt and ſureſt way to <hi>Pray in the Spirit,</hi> is to take the aſſiſtance of well compoſed Forms of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31416:61"/>Prayer, and to have them either in a Book before our Eyes, or well imprinted in our Memories. They are in a grievous Error, that imagine that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>praying in or by the Spirit,</hi> oppoſeth the Practice of our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſtrengthens the irregular Devotions of the gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. For if you pleaſe to Examine the meaning of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> you ſhall find that he never intended any ſuch matter. In the 6th. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and 18 <hi>ver.</hi> he exhorts them to pray with all Prayer and Supplication in every Seaſon, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Spirit, which he cannot underſtand of the Prayers proceeding from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inſpirations or abilities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us by God, the giver of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good gift; becauſe ſuch inſpirations are not common to all, and every one hath not ſuch a quick Fancy or voluble Tongue, to be able to pray in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo that every Perſon is not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to fulfil this Command, which, as all other Commands of God, is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and hath a ſpecial regard to Mens faculties and abilities. Therefore ſeeing theſe words are directed to every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, they relate not to the gift, but to that which is commonly ſtyled the Spirit, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duty of Prayer, which every Chriſtian may peform by uſing endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. St <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning therefore is,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31416:62"/>that we ſhould in our Prayers to God, not be content with the Lip Service, but inwardly heartily, and affectionately, to pray to him, and employ all the abilities of the Soul in offering them up to God; for in this part of our Devotions, we muſt obſerve the ſame method, as in the others, and act with the ſame abilities. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5th <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiens,</hi> and the 19th <hi>ver.,</hi> adviſeth them to <hi>make Melody in their Hearts to the Lord.</hi> Here is that ſpiritual Service required from us, a ſerious, real, and hearty Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, wherein the Soul is concerned as well as the Body. Likewiſe our Saviour Chriſt, in anſwer to the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> tells her, <hi>that God is a Spirit, and that they that will worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> That is in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Corporal appearances of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> an inward and ſoul Worſhip, without which all our moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidual attendances upon holy Duties, are frivolous and vain. In the ſame ſenſe, we are to underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s praying and ſinging with the Spirit, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14. for he expreſly ſaith, <hi>if I pray in an unknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth.</hi> He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it his Spirit, that is, his Soul, which muſt be concerned in all our Prayers to God, either by compoſing them and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them, or elſe by preſenting the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31416:62"/>Prayers already compoſed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with the underſtanding and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they may proceed from us as our own.</p>
            <p>I confeſs St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s words, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. ſeems to favour the contrary interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he adviſeth to pray <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Holy Ghoſt. Which words the admirers of new Modes and extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayers, underſtand of the gift of Prayer, that we ſhould depend upon the Spirit of God, and expect from his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſpirations, the matter and manner of our Prayers, without limitting our ſelves, and this unlimited Being, to any certain Form. That we ſhould make uſe of thoſe expreſſions as proceed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his divine ſuggeſtions. But this can never be the meaning of this wiſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; for though it were true, what this interpretation ſuppoſeth, that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful have the gift of Prayer, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with the Holy Ghoſt. That in that Duty he governs their Tongues and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and furniſhes them with proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, words, and matter, which I confeſs may happen in extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; yet in our ordinary Devotions, to expect ſuch extraordinary movings of God's Holy Spirit in our Souls, not to contribute any thing of our ſelves, but our weakneſſes and unpreparedneſs, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31416:63"/>wholly to depend upon the Holy Ghoſt, is a preſumption and indiſcretion which agrees not with God's uſual methods, of acting with his Creatures, neither in Nature nor in Grace; for his Bleſſings and Power appear commonly in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious endeavours, and if he gives the Form and Beauty to any thing, he takes the matter from thoſe things that he hath already made.</p>
            <p>But take notice, that St. <hi>Jude</hi> adviſeth us to pray, not by the Holy Ghoſt, but in the Holy Ghoſt. That is, either in that method and manner, or according to thoſe Rules which the Holy Ghoſt hath given us in his holy Word; for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies <hi>according.</hi> The meaning therefore is, That we ſhould pray for thoſe things that agree with the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghoſt, that we ſhould obſerve thoſe particulars outwardly and inwardly, as may recommend our Prayers to God, and employ thoſe graces which the Holy Ghoſt hath beſtowed upon us, for a more zealous offering up of our Prayers to God. A true Chriſtian may want the gift of Prayer, but no true and ſincere Chriſtian can want the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the ſtate of regeneration, nor thoſe inward abilities which are requiſite for Prayer. For this inward breathing of the Soul towards Heaven, is the very life of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31416:63"/>a Child of God, and a principle of all Spiritual motion. Though he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſame diſpoſition and a fit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Prayer, becauſe theſe abilities may be hindred, and obſtructed by ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful impediments; nevertheleſs the work of regeneration is no ſooner begun in us, but we are taught by the Holy Ghoſt, to call God <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>That the Spirit helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerve Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> This and all other paſſages that mention praying in, or by the Spirit, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to take with us the aſſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit in our addreſſes to him, and imploy the abilities which he hath given us for that good purpoſe. They may take notice of our own natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and weakneſſes, and adviſe us to make uſe of the Spiritual helps that the Holy Ghoſt gives us; that we might pray to God in a manner acceptable to him. But there is none that forbids the uſe of thoſe Forms, which God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath Eſtabliſhed in our Church. There is no paſſage nor Text of Scripture, that requires thee to wait for a ſudden inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from above, that diſallows of a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31416:64"/>and religious preparation, or of preſcribed Prayers, compoſed by Men as much enlightned by the Spirit of God, as any now alive. Why therefore may not the uſe of theſe Prayers, be called pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, if I offer them up in that devout manner as God requires? Why ſhall I prefer the new Modes of Men, whoſe abilities and integrity I know not perhaps, to thoſe that I am ſure are agreeable with God's Will and Word? Why ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the old Prayers of the Holy Ghoſt, and be ſo impatient to hear new, which I know not from whence they are, till I have taken the pains to examine them?</p>
            <p>If therefore I am an auditor, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have I to refuſe the Prayers of the Church, compoſed by the directions of the Spirit of God, to be of a conſtant uſe in the Publick Worſhip of our great Creator, to be ſo fond of new Modes and new Prayers of Men, that pretend to a divine inſpiration, but how truly I know not? God's Holy Spirit is no favourer of the pride, preſumption and ſancineſs of thoſe perſons that ruſh into God's Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip without a due preparation. And if they be prepared both for matter and expreſſions in the publick Prayers which they pronounce, what reaſon have I to prefer this Prayer compoſed by this private Perſon, tho' with the aſſiſtance
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31416:64"/>of God's Holy Spirit, to the religious Prayers of the whole Church, allowed of by ſo many wiſe, learned, and Godly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, enlightned alſo doubtleſs with the ſame Spirit? Is that the Prayer, by, or in the Spirit? And is not this likewiſe, if I perform it in a Spiritual manner, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up with my Soul and affections? O! how idle and frivolous! How vain and impertinent are theſe prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Set Forms of Prayer!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But theſe perſons that are ſo much admired by ignorant People for their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, in Prayers of any long continuance, are admired for that which they themſelves cannot perform. For if they pray <hi>extempore</hi> without prepararation, ſome in the Congregation may perhaps really pray to God, but the perſons, that pronounce the Prayers, whilſt their fancy is ſo buſily employed in ſeeking for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and expreſſions, can never oblige the affections of the Soul to offer their Prayers up to God in that devout manner as is required. This Prayer therefore, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Speaker, is but a Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ech and no Prayer, let it be never ſo Eloquent, and never ſo much able to ſtir up the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the hearers. Our minds cannot be totally employed in two actions at once; whilſt our apprehenſions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted to ſeek for words, and fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31416:65"/>they cannot be fixed upon that Divine Being, unto whom we make our addreſſes; nor cauſe in the Soul that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and thoſe affections, which at ſuch a time are neceſſary; they cannot mind the greatneſs of their Wants, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a ſpeedy ſupply, and the uſefulneſs of thoſe things that are petitioned for. Their Souls cannot be at liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the homage due to God's greatneſs, and an earneſt affection for thoſe Bleſſings that they ſtand in need of. All their care is to move the Tongue and not the Heart, whilſt the one is buſily employed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is unconcerned in the Service.</p>
            <p>I cannot think that there are any of ſuch an extraordinary, and quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as to be abe to furniſh their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with plenty of matter and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at the ſame moment, to mind all thoſe things that are needful to keep our Souls in a ſit diſpoſition for Prayer. 'Tis not poſſible to divide this ſingle Being into ſo many parts. Such an activity ſeems to me almoſt as great a miracle, as that of the Ubiquity of Chriſt's Humane Body, and is ſubject to the like abſurdities. The Unity of the Soul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d the Unity of all its Faculties, require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſingle Object at once. It may be ſo quick as to ſly to another in an inſtant; but this change, and this motion of the apprehenſion, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31416:65"/>of two or three Objects at one ſingle inſtant, plainly diſcovers the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of praying well, and keeping the Soul in a worthy diſpoſition, and the affections in a ſit temper, in extemporary and long Prayers; becauſe the mind that ſhould take this charge, and the care to ſummon the affections to the performance of their Duty, is buſily employed in other matters. Now without this conjunction of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and this concernment of the Soul, no Devotion nor Prayer can be ſaid to be ſpiritual, or performed with, or in the Spirit; for tho' this ſhould be underſtood of the holy Spirit of God, it is not to be imagined that he will act in us without our aſſiſtance and cooperation, and if he did, the Devotion is his, and none of ours.</p>
            <p>For theſe and other Reaſons, it is a matter of great difficulty, to keep the unruly and wandring thoughts of the mind, and the ſeveral affections of the Heart, with the other parts of the Soul, in a praying temper, in all extemporary and long Prayers: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore the eaſieſt and ſureſt way to pray in the Spirit, is to take the aſſiſtance of well compoſed Forms, and to have them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Book before us, or well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our Memories. This is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence deducible from what we have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31416:66"/>already ſaid concerning that praying in, or by the Spirit, intended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Jude.</hi> But if there be any ſo ſtrongly prejudiced againſt Set Forms, and ſo much bewitched with the pretended pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, or by the Spirit, as to refuſe to acquieſce to what we have already alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him ſeriouſly conſider, That there can be no praying in the Spirit, whatever interpretation we give to the paſſages of Holy Scripture concerning that purpoſe, whether we underſtand them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gift, or in relation to the Duty and Spirit of Prayer, without a real and hearty compliance of the Soul with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſion; without an inward ſenſe of the things petitioned for, and without a devout compoſure of all the parts of the Soul. Now if you enquire how this is produced in us? I muſt tell you that it is not without our aſſidual endeavours, for the mind ought to have a continual eye upon the Soul and diſpoſition, it ought to recollect and call back our wandring thoughts, and labour to expreſs both a feeling of its wants, and a dutiful reverence for the Majeſty of God. This being of an abſolute neceſſity, in order to a zealous offering up of our Prayers in the Spirit, it is needful that the mind ſhould be at liberty for that purpoſe. Now let any Man of Reaſon, ſeriouſly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31416:66"/>ſider whether it hath not more freedom in the uſe of Set Forms, imprinted either in our memories, or our Books, than in extemporary praying; whether it is not eaſier for the Soul in ſuch a caſe to act its part, and contribute to the Devotions, than in ſuch Prayers where it hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Offices to perform? Grant it poſſible, that ſome of an extraordinary ability, learning, and natural parts (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine to be) ſhould be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the inward Duty of the Soul in Prayer, as well as the outward, in extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayers. Conſider whether they cannot with more eaſe, pray with the aſſiſtance of Set Forms. And why ſhall they be denyed of thoſe helps in a buſineſs of ſo much weight and difficulty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holieſt and moſt devout Soul comes far ſhort of that perfection and exactneſs which God's greatneſs requites at our hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That muſt needs be the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt and ſureſt way of praying by the Spirit, which is offered to the weaker ſort of Chriſtians, as the readieſt help to their Devotions; for the duties of Religion are always proportioned to the ſlender abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch perſons: both God and the Church are wont to condeſcend to their mean gifts, and furniſh them with ſuch aſſiſtances as they want for the diſcharge
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31416:67"/>of the Offices required from them. Now from the beginning, Set Forms of Prayer have been allowed in the Churches of God to theſe perſons, becauſe it is well known, that they are not able to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſeveral wants to God as they ſhould, and in that manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us mortal Men. If therefore this manner of praying is, as it is generally confeſſed, an help to the weaker kind of Chriſtians, why may it not be alſo to the ſtronger? No doubt but ſuch a one may uſe theſe helps with more advantage: A ſtaff is good in the hand of a feeble body, to make it walk with more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and is likewiſe as beneficial to a ſtrong perſon that undertakes a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The difference is, that the one cannot poſſibly walk without it, and the other may march a few ſteps, and it may be, proceed on in his way without it, but for more eaſe and better conveniency, it is ſit in a tedious march, that he ſhould have the aſſiſtance of a Staff, which may ſuccour his infirmities, and may comfort his wearied Limbs. Therefore it is not a ſufficient cauſe to oblige us to reject uſeful things, to ſay Men may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. I think it wiſdom not to caſt away ſuch beneficial helps to our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are Set Forms, becauſe we may be ſo fond of our abilities, as to think
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31416:67"/>our ſelves able to compoſe ſome of an higher ſtrain, and more paſſionate; ſome that may gratifie our own and the Peoples corrupt humour, which uſually deſpiſeth things that are common, when they have not well conſidered their worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider how apt our thoughts are to be wandring, and our minds to be drawn aſide from our Devotions. Therefore that is the eaſieſt and ſureſt way of praying well, which ſixeth our minds, and ſettles our thoughts upon the weighty buſineſs in hand. Now I dare affirm, That there is nothing ſo well able to do this good office to us, as Forms of Prayers judiciouſly compoſed, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our memories, or before us in a Book; for in the former method of praying, the Soul is kept from wandring to and fro; and in the latter it is tyed and limited by the ſenſe of ſeeing; and though in ſuch caſes it may take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtep aſide, and eſcape out of the other ſenſes, yet we muſt all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that a Judicious Chriſtian can, by the aſſiſtance of his Senſes, be better able to limit and ſtop the wanderings of his mind, and the unrulineſs of his thoughts, than when he hath little or no uſe of them. To conclude, Nothing but the pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs of ſome, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and fooliſh humours of others,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31416:68"/>have taught men to reject and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temn our ſet Forms of Prayer, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Church of <hi>England;</hi> which, both for matter and manner, are the beſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy that ever was uſed either in the Primitive or Modern Churches of Chriſt: And there is nothing that hinders Men from uſing them with comfort and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their Souls, but their ſtrong diſpleaſures, their frowad tempers, and their itching Ears; a Diſeaſe which hath infected the heart and fountain, as well as the Senſe and Organ of hearing.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore intreat thee, my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, ſeriouſly to peruſe theſe Reaſons that I have mentioned, and let not any popular Miſtake, nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſpirations of the Spirit, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee in the devour uſe of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Church, chiefly in the publick Worſhip of thy God; where Reaſon and Religion require from thee Uniformity, and Unity with the reſt of thy Brethren. And in thy private Family I would have thee to uſe the ſame Prayers; ſuch, I mean, as are proper for that place and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I know that ſeveral Pious and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men have lately, and in the former Age, furniſhed our Nation with Books of this kind; but I think that their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious labours, fitted for thoſe times, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31416:68"/>anſwerable to their private deſigns, will not hinder this preſent Treatiſe from being uſeful in its kind, for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miſtakes lately crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and the miſchiefs that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Enemies at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. I find them buſily employed in contriving our ruine, and in poiſoning our people with ſtrange Principles, by ſpreading in the Country new Pamphlets, printed for that evil purpoſe. I wiſh that we were as watchful for our own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The beſt means for that intent, is to employ the ſame policy, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our People with new and freſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, which may ſerve as Antidotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Venom of their Enemies and ours. Such Treatiſes therefore as this, I think to be very ſeaſonable for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided times. I am certain that it is much wanting in the place where I live, and to the people committed to my Charge. My firſt deſign was only to have a regard to their private wants, at the requeſts of one of my Pariſhioners; but when I conſidered, that tho' Providence hath given me a particular inſpection over the Inhabitants of a ſmall diviſion in a Wilderneſs, it is my Duty to aim in all my actions at the general good, I reſolved to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the publick, ſuch a Treatiſe as might ſerve, and be uſeful to all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31416:69"/>in our Reformed Church; and in it to have a general aim at the benefit of all Chriſtians; for I think that there is none in the ſtate of Grace, or within the limits of Chriſt's Church, but he ſhall in this ſhort Tract find Prayers and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which may ſute with the condition and temper of his Soul.</p>
            <p>You therefore that deſire that Religion ſhould flouriſh amongſt us, neglect not its chief Duty, but ſee that it be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved in your own practice, and that of thoſe recommended to your care. As ſoon as your Children begin to ſpeak, teach them to cry <hi>Abba Father, which art in Heaven.</hi> Call upon them Morning and Evening, to implore Protection and Aſſiſtance. Let their Tongues be uſed betimes, to tune forth the Praiſes of their Maker, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Providence of God. Remember that Piety, with the Bleſſings of Heaven, is the beſt and moſt durable portion which you can procure to your little ones. And the only means to obtain it, is carefully to practiſe this and all other Duties of Religion. As they grow to years of Underſtanding: Let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on in learning the Prayers that are ſit for their capacity, and ſuitable to their Abilities. Let them know that their chief dependency is upon that Almighty
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31416:69"/>Being, who hath created the World, and put them into it, to ſerve and worſhip him. This daily practice of ſeeking to God in Prayer, will keep youth from all thoſe extravagancies and vitious actions, by which the Gallants of our time are become a reproach to Chriſtianity and Humanity it ſelf. Thou ſhalt never have the diſpleaſure to ſee thy Son and thy Daughter either unruly in their behaviour, or prophane in their diſcourſe, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in their Lives; if thou wilt, when they are young, train them up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continual obſervance of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Prayer; for there is nothing more proper, and of a greater force, to keep the Souls of Men from the temptations of our days, and from all diſorders, as this Correſpondency with God in Prayer. Man therefore, in this reſpect, is like a Watch or a Clock, the leaſt neglect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the Motion, and ſteals him inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly into improficiency or an oſſence. Pray therefore, O Chriſtian Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! and pray without ceaſing: In proſperity and adverſity, let your requeſts be made known unto God: Be not ſilent when God requires you to ſpeak: In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eſtate Providence may caſt you, make uſe of thoſe Prayers that are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your condition. If you can offer up the Prayers of our Church with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31416:70"/>any ſatisfaction to your minds, uſe them rather than others. But if your prejudices be ſo ſtrong, and your averſion ſo invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, that you cannot yet reliſh them, uſe the other Prayers more agreeable to your affections. However, neglect not this moſt important, this moſt weighty, and moſt indiſpenſible Duty, but perform it with all the Care and Devotion that God's greatneſs, and thy mean condition requires from thee.</p>

               <p>O Gracious God, the Creator and Protector of Mankind, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued goodneſs we have lately experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſafety and preſervation of the laſt Night. We bleſs thy Holy Name, for this and all other expreſſions of thy Mercy to us; we acknowledge, that as thou art the Author of our Beings, it is thy good Providence that maintains and defends them from all dangers and Enemies that incompaſs us about. It is thy watchful Eye that ſees all their contrivances to deſtroy us: It is thy Wiſdom that knows how to defeat their Craftieſt purpoſes: It is thy Power alone, that can diſappoint and oppoſe their wicked and helliſh Plots. We are not ignorant, O Lord, of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and our continual dangers, dangers that proceed from the contrivances of Spiritual and Temporal Enemies; we deſire therefore to be heartily thankful, for we are really ſenſible of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful protection hitherto, and to aſcribe all the Honour and Praiſe of our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and deliverance, to thy Wiſdom and Providence alone. But, O merciful Father, let this expreſſion of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the foundation of all thy Bleſſings,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31416:74"/>be ſtill continued to us; we are ſenſible of our undeſervings, our ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are multiplied, our provocations and ingratitudes have been many; our many deficien ies in all our Duties, might juſtly cauſe thee to leave us to our ſelves for the future, and expoſe us naked to the ſubtilties and power of our Enemies, who would quickly devour us. But we implore thy mercy at this time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee to forgive us our Treſpaſſes, to pardon our Infirmities, and to paſs by all our Tranſgreſſions, for the Lord Jeſus his ſake. In his Name, and through his Merits, we approach with all humility to the throne of thy grace, to beg the forgiveneſs of all our Iniquities, and the continuance of thy protection and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Temporal and Spiritual. How weak are we of our ſelves? How ſoon caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Graves? and what is Man, that he ſhould be able to defend us, when the leaſt blaſt deprives him of Life and Being? Thou art therefore, and thou alone, O great God of Heaven! thou art only able to defend us in the following courſe of our Life, from viſible and inviſible pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: Let thy Mercy be continued to us, ſhelter us from the malicious deſigns of all our Enemies, fruſtrate their wicked purpoſes; lead us in all our ways, direct us in all our paths, bleſs us in all our
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31416:74"/>undertakings; we live in a crooked Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in a world that overflows with ſin and wickedneſs, and our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is amongſt evil-doers, let therefore thy Wiſdom and thy fear ſo poſſeſs our Souls, that we may not be drawn away by the Vices of the Age, nor intangled in ſuch Labryinths of Sin, as might indanger our eternal welfare. Suffer us not to be inticed with the allurements of unlawful Pleaſure and Profit. We truſt not to our ſelves, O Lord, and our own frail reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, becauſe we have broken them ſo often, that we have cauſe to miſtruſt our ſelves, and to rely chiefly upon thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful guidance. Let thy Truth direct us, and thy Spirit lead us, as well as thy Power protect us, from the invaſion of Error and Vice; give us a right underſtanding of thy Will, an unchangeable reſolution to practiſe it; ſuffer us not to be drawn aſide neither by fear nor by profit, from the profeſſion of that pure Religion, in which we have had the happineſs to be inſtructed. Give us all grace to value and prize this thy great Mercy, that we are Chriſtians, and ſuch Chriſtians as have the benefits of thy ſacred Oracles. O let us not be ſo unworthy to forſake that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which only we are to expect Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Give us Grace to follow the Bleſſed Rules of good living that we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31416:75"/>have learned; keep us from ſin, and of all ſins, chiefly from the ſins againſt our own Conſciences and knowledge. Give us peaceable Minds, quiet diſpoſitions, with a willing reſignation of our ſelves to thy Wiſe Providence in all things, wean our Hearts and Affections from the World; let not its Vanities poſſeſs any longer our affections. Let the knowledge that all things ſhall work together for our good, cauſe us to ſubmit without murmuring, to all the Croſſes that we may meet with. And as our time here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is but of a ſhort continuance, give us grace to mind our latter end, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for our diſſolution betimes, to live always in expectation of another, and a more happy life, where we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee neither Sorrow nor Pain.</p>

               <p>Bleſs all our Relations whereſoever they be diſperſed; let thy Mercy and Truth guide them all the days of their Lives: Bleſs this Nation unto which we belong, puniſh us not according to our juſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and provocations; lay not upon us the guilt of innocent Blood. But pardon the extravagancy of our lives, and cauſe a real Reformation to be practiſed, as well as profeſſed amongſt us; thou giveſt us Temporal Mercies in abundance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thy Spiritual to us; ſuffer not our Enemies to deprive us of thy Truth and Goſpel; watch over us, and diſappoint all their wicked purpoſes for our Ruine, and give us all Hearts to be truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the many Favours, Bleſſings, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

               <p>ALmighty God, by whoſe Gracious Providence I am yet alive, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped out of all the dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this mortal life, by whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Protection I have been preſerved the laſt Night from all Corporal and Spiritual Enemies: I adore thy Divine Mercy and Goodneſs, ſo viſibly expreſſed in every moment of my life. I praiſe thy Holy Name for this, and all other favours received from thy Wiſdom and Power; I glorifie thine infinite Majeſty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thee, O! my God, to be the Author of my Preſervation, as well as of my Being; of my ſelf I am not able to reſiſt the leaſt danger or Enemy; were it not for thy watchful Eye and Power, I had been long ago in my Grave; but thy goodneſs hath yet ſpared me, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my unworthineſs, and the many Provocations of my Life: O Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father, thy Bleſſings have been heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me in abundance, though I have returned thee for them all, nothing but ingratitude and Sin; when I make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlexion upon my ſelf, and thy liberality, upon my paſt behaviour, and thy manifold Bleſſings beſtowed upon me from day to day; I cannot but wonder at the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31416:79"/>of thy Mercy, which could not yet be exhauſted, nor diſcouraged by my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs; but let the Senſe of thy Love to me, change and alter the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of my Soul, the reſolution of my Mind, and the Actions of my Life; ſuffer me not to preſume upon theſe outward Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thine Affection to me; but let them inflame my Soul with a ſincere Love for thee my God, and with a fervent zeal for thy Glory: Suffer me not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the powerful temptations of the World, nor to be drawn aſide by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of Sin. I am ſo ſenſible, Lord, of the weakneſs of my own Nature, as not to truſt upon my ſtrength, which hath ſo often yielded to wicked entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; aſſiſt me therefore, my God, with thy Divine and Holy Spirit, defeat the Devil's Power, diſappoint all his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes, and lead me through this wicked World in thy Faith and Fear. Continue alſo thy Protection to my weak Body, preſerve me from all dangers and Enemies, defend me from all Bloody and Cruel Souls, that I may live here below in the Service of my Generation, and in glorifying thee my Creator. Bleſs me in the Works of my Calling, give me a contented Mind, ſatisfied with the Events of thy Providence; that I may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any thing that ſhall happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31416:79"/>to my deſire, and expectation, and a full reſignation to thy Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Suffer not my Soul to be too much in love with my ſelf, nor with any thing here below, that I may avoid the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Vices of Pride, ſelf-conceitedneſs, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Luſt and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which in theſe latter days poſſeſs Mens Minds, and hurry them into the Labyrinths that lead to Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Lord, I reſign my ſelf into thy hands; I deſire to depend upon thee, to be govern'd by thee, and to live for thee. Enlighten therefore my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thy ſacred Truth, ſanctiſie my Will and Affections with thy Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the longer I live, let me draw nearer, to thy likeneſs. Strengthen my Soul with an aſſurance upon thy Love and Protection, and pacifie all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of my Paſſions, that whatſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency I meet with in my converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here below, I may enjoy a quiet and peaceable Temper of Spirit, which is ſo acceptable in thy ſight; in Proſperity and Adverſity, in Sickneſs and in Health, grant me an equality of Mind, not puſt up with the one, nor caſt down with the other; but give me Grace, that bearing willingly my Croſs after Chriſt my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, I may preſs forward towards that Immortal Reward, which thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31416:80"/>for them that love and fear thee. In whatſoever condition thy Providence ſhall be pleaſed to bring me, give me, I beſeech thee, a diſpoſition ſuitable to it, that in following the Holy Example of my Glorious Redeemer, and imitating his Goodneſs, Piety, Charity, Patience in ſuffering, Holineſs and other Vertues, I may glorifie thy Name on Earth, grace the Profeſſion of thy true Religion, and prepare my ſelf for Eternity; for that purpoſe, grant that I may employ all my Talents in thoſe good uſes for which they are deſigned, that when I ſhall render up my accounts to thee, I may not be aſhamed of my Actions.

               <p>I humbly beſeech thy Divine Majeſty, to be gracious, not only to my ſelf, but alſo to all my Relations; receive into thy Favour and Protection, all thoſe that are committed to my Care, or that are near or dear unto me in Blood and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity; preſerve their Souls from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Infection of the times, and their Lives from dangers and Enemies, and give them all Grace, to ſerve and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee their God on Earth.</p>

               <p>O Heavenly Father, my great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Protector, thy Holy Name be praiſed for all thy Mercies, chiefly for the quiet reſt of the laſt Night. At every moment I feel the expreſſions of thy goodneſs; thou ceaſeſt not to ſhew me ſome tokens of thy Liberality, ſince thou haſt given me this Being. O merciful God, how great and many are thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to me in theſe few Minutes that I have ſpent in the World; I perceive that thou art the inexhauſtible Fountain of all good, and the boundleſs Ocean of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: To thy Divine Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I make my Addreſs, to ſupply the daily neceſſities of this weak Body and ſinful Soul, which proceed from thee. Forgive, I beſeech thee, O my God, the miſtakes and frailties of my youth. As I am ſenſible of my frequent miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, cauſe me alſo to be ſenſible of thy Mercy and Pardon. I am entered into the World in a ſtate of imperfection, I carry about me ſtrong Inclinations to Sin, and the breach of thy Sacred Laws, which I cannot ſhake off in a moment; but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, blot out all mine Iniquities, and aſſiſt with thy Divine Spirit, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſolutions, and Religious temper of

Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me not to be carried away by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of Hereſie and Error; but as thou haſt cauſed me to be born, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated by Baptiſm into the profeſſion of thy true Religion; give me grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all the Temptations that may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw me from it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it to the laſt moment of my days.

               <p>I beſeech thee alſo, Merciful Father, to ſend and continue to me all things needful for my weak Body, grant me Life and Health, that I may glorifie thee on this ſide the Grave, as thou wilt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me on the other ſide.

Preſerve me from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Enemies; ſuffer them not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon me, but limit their malice and rage.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31416:83"/>at every ſtep that I ſhall make, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company all my endeavours and actions with ſucceſs and bleſſing.

Grant me, I beſeech thee, O overflowing Goodneſs, all the conveniencies of this Life; ſanctifie what thou haſt already given, and make me uſeful, and a Comfort to all my Relations.

Our Iniquities are many, and our Tranſgreſſions are multiplyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. We feel within us a forward inclination to that which is unlawful; we carry about us a Body of Sin, and the leaſt Temptation draws us aſide from thy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31416:90"/>holy Ways. How negligent have we been of thy Commands? How vitious in our Lives? How careleſs in our Duties? How unthankful for all thy Mercies? We can give no account of the number of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, for they are numberleſs. Therefore we humble our ſelves before thee in a deep ſenſe of our own ſinfulneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we caſt away all confidence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon our own Merits. But we come to thee with a Confidence upon Chriſt's Merits, truſting upon his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and gracious invitations; For his ſake, O merciful Father, forgive us all our Treſpaſſes, magnifie thy Divine goodneſs, by the pardon of our great and hainous Offences: Look upon the Atonement made for us, and in conſideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of our great Saviour, ſpilt for our Redemption; accept of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Prayers at this time. Take not away from us only the guilt, but alſo the Corruption of Sin, that we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our Provocations againſt thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty. As thou haſt given us a ſenſe of our Ignorance and Weakneſs; give us the proper Remedies to theſe two Evils, enlighten our Underſtandings more and more with thy Bleſſed Truth; purifie our Wills from all unregenerate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſanctifie and change the whole frame of our Souls according to thy revealed

For that purpoſe, grant us we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, good God, an increaſe of all our Graces, give life and growth to theſe Seeds of Holineſs and Immortality; ſtrengthen the Intereſt of Piety in every one of us, with a holy dread of thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juſtice, and a bleſſed Love for thee our God, who only art lovely. Open our Eyes, that we may perceive the Beauty, and Excellency of Vertue, and the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and danger of thoſe ſins we have been moſt inclinable to practiſe. Let the woful circumſtances of our Boſom Luſts, viſible by our own experience and others Examples; reclaim us betimes to an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thy Sacred Laws; make us truly ſenſible both of the ſhame that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends upon Sin, and of the miſery that conſequently follows it, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the great Work of Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and vigorouſly proſecute it, till we have brought under all our irregular inclinations, which are ſo imperious in the Children of diſobedience.

O Lord, I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son; my Tranſgreſſions are multiplyed every day, and mine Iniquities are without number. How eaſily have I yielded to the Power of Temptations! how often have I broken thy ſacred Laws! Gracious God, be merciful, be merciful to me a Sinner; blot out all mine Iniquities, and forgive me for the ſake of my dear and only Saviour, who is dead, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for me.

               <p>HOw often have I taſted and felt the goodneſs of my God! He is that full Ocean of Mercy and Sweetneſs, from whence theſe Streams proceed by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſations and Methods. He is that bottomleſs Fountain that never will be exhauſted. Here, here are tokens of his Love to us, and care of our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, before our Eyes: Theſe Creatures are ſent to mend the daily breaches of this outward Tabernacle, to recruit our Mortal Weakneſſes with a freſh ſupply, to corroborate the decaying ſtrength of Nature with new Spirits: We ſee, by experience, that theſe Bodies that God hath made, he is careful to maintain,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31416:97"/>and by the Influence of the Heavens, and the Fruitfulneſs of the Earth, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with all their Wants. O wonderful Providence! How full and plentiful are thy Stores! that ſo great a ſhare is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for me. How rich is that Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that when all my Fellow Creatures, ſo many Millions in Number, are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vouchſafes me ſo great a Lot and large Portion. He can never want, that entertains a good Correſpondency with the great Purveyor of Mankind, whilſt the Avenues and Conveyances are open. O ſhut not up thy mercy from us; for let my Eſtate be never ſo great, and the Proviſion for my Body be never ſo large, alas theſe poor ſenſeleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot benefit me without thy Bleſſing accompanies them; theſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels may as ſoon choak as feed me; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that inviſible Vertue which thou alone canſt ſend along with them; I humbly crave it at thy good hands, my good God; let not my Sins ſower or poiſon theſe thy Mercies; let me not truſt too much upon theſe outward aſſiſtances of Life and Health, but as by thy daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, thou haſt taught me to depend chiefly upon thy Liberality, let me look up to, and expect from thee daily food and nouriſhment; grant me a thankful Heart, never to forget ſo great a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

Theſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which thou haſt ſo wonderfully made, and preſerves with ſuch care, are of that Excellency, and deſigned for thoſe Noble and Divine purpoſes, that they muſt not be diſgrac'd nor polluted with Vice. Theſe Creatures thou haſt appointed for our Refreſhment, not for the diſhonour or ruine of our Bodies.

               <p>But this Food of my Body minds me of that of my Soul. I have another more Spiritual and Divine Being that I muſt feed and cloath.

               <p>O!

               <p>O Supernatural Goodneſs, it is in this Action that thou haſt diſcovered to all intelligent Beings the unfathom'd depths of Love, Kindneſs, Mercy, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Compaſſion. Here it is that the Divine Bounty appears in its greateſt Splendour. Is my God come to viſit me in my decayed Eſtate? Doth his mercy ſtretch forth a hand to fetch me out of that Abyſs of Miſery, into which I was with the reſt of Mankind falling irrecoverably? Has he ſo much love and humility as to cloath himſelf with the rags of my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, that I might be lifted up, and one day adorned with the Crown of his Glory. O bleſſed exchange, that beſpeaks a mercy and love in my Saviour, beyond my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion! What wonderful and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Methods appointed by the Divine Wiſdom, to bring to paſs this happy end! Give me leave, with the Wiſe Men of the Eaſt, and the Shepherds of the Fields, my merciful Saviour, to viſit thee in thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and from thence to view the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps and proceedings of this ſtupendious Mercy, as they appear in every part and paſſage of thy Life and Death, of and our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:31416:107"/>Redemption. O Merciful God, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thy mercy in thine Incarnation is clearly ſeen in the greatneſs of thine abaſement, in the conformity to ſuch an apoſtate, and offending Nature, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the weakneſs of our Humanity, and ingaging thy ſelf in a Race full of the moſt grievous Sufferings, without the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary conveniencies of Life to ſweeten the bitterneſs of thy griefs, and mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate thy ſorrows. How merciful doſt thou ſhew thy ſelf to ſuch as wanted thine aſſiſtance. Thy mercy gave eyes to the Blind, feet to the Lame, health to the Sick, ſoundneſs to the Diſtemper'd, deliverance to the Poſſeſſed, pardon to the troubled in mind, and life to the dead. Never any did ſeek unto thee for help, but thy compaſſion did as ſoon grant it as it was deſired, unto them alſo whoſe eſtate rendred them incapable of thy moſt ſignal favours: Not only thy Friends, but thine Enemies too have felt and experienced the tenderneſs of thy mercy. What tears of compaſſion didſt thou not ſhed at the ſight of <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> Sins, and at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of its approaching Judgments! How full of mercy was thy juſt indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to behold the hardneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> hearts, after ſo many, and ſuch aparent Miracles, the Evidences of a Divine power and approbation! How full of mercy was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:31416:107"/>this dying Saviour, to pray for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, at the very moment of loading him with affronts and contempt!</p>
               <p>O Divine Sacrifice of Mercy! to live ſuch a painful Life for our ſakes, was a great expreſſion of thy love and mercy; but to dye for us, to pay for the price of our Redemption, and ſuffer ſuch an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and grievous Death, was a far greater. Mercy, O my Saviour, leads thee through Death and the Grave, to a joyful Reſurrection. Every ſtep is a ſtep of Divine Mercy relating to us; it ſhines moſt viſibly, in releaſing our great Surety out of the Grave, where our Enemies had ſhut him up; in affording us ſuch an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the accompliſhment of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and in admitting our Nature into the Coeleſtial Manſions. Bleſſed be this wonderful Mercy, in that it hath called us to, and made us partakers of the Benefits of our Redeemer's Death and Paſſion, and giveth us ſuch fair hopes and aſſurances of a Glorious immortality with and by him. I beſeech thee let me never be unworthy of ſo much goodneſs. And ſeeing thy mercy, O my God, hath look'd upon the greateſt of Sinners, ſhall I doubt of; or queſtion whether it will be extended to me? Seeing it was deſigned for my benefit, and this good Saviour bore my Sins upon his Croſs, ſhall I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

Thy forbearance

Shall men live and act in defiance of thine Almighty Power? Shall they violate thy Sacred Laws, and tread under foot thy Divine Authority? and ſhall not thine All-ſeeing Eye take notice, and thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted Majeſty be ſenſible of ſuch hainous Crimes. I appeal to the Conſciences of the moſt obdurate Wretch, and vileſt Contemner of a Deity, whether the fears and diſquietneſs of their inward Being, which we call the Soul, the Spirit, or the Mind, do not ſuffiently witneſs, and tell them there is a Superior Juſtice to which they are anſwerable for their offences.

Look back, O my Soul, into former Ages, and ſee whether thou canſt find in the Records of Antiquity any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer footſteps of this Juſtice: I ſee it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear viſible in the overwhelming the firſt World, and commanding the waters of the Seas, and the Heavens, to waſh away the firſt Generations of Men.

How hot and dreadful was thy Juſtice, when that delicions Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> was by fire and brimſtone from above, turned into a ſtinking and noiſom Lake, that yet to the World's end ſhews the Signs and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of a Divine Diſpleaſure! How grievous was thy Juſtice in puniſhing the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that rebellious City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the Crimes of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, when hundreds of thouſands were deſtroyed, their Glory levelled in the duſt, and the reſt ſcattered among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!

Wean mine affections from the World, and all theſe Vanities, that they may be a preparation for greater and more laſting Riches, which thou haſt laid up in thine Heavenly Sanctuary, for them that love and fear thee. If theſe things are ſo ſweet and pleaſing to us now, conveyed to us at ſuch a diſtance off, and attended with much labour and ſorrow, how ſweet and raviſhing will that plenty, and thoſe riches be, which thou wilt grant at a nearer approach! when thou ſhalt wipe away all tears from our eyes, and there

I acknowledge them to proceed from thee my good God, and to be expreſſions of thy great and unwearied mercy.

What could my induſtry, labour or care do, if thou didſt not accompany them with thy continual Bleſſings?

What little dependance is there upon this Sun-ſhine? How ſoon may the Clouds of adverſity, deprive me of all this Comfort?

There is a continual revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all worldly Affairs, and nothing is ſettled upon a ſure <hi>Baſis;</hi> but ſeeing the greateſt Empires and Kingdoms have had a ſucceſſion of Adverſities that have follow'd their greateſt Proſperities cloſe at the heels, what reaſon have I to build upon that which is not ſecured to me, but may vaniſh in a night, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a moment?

Let me not be ſurpriſed at a bitter Cup that thy Providence may give me to drink. It is impoſſible and contrary to our daily experience, that every thing ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to us ſweet and pleaſant for ever. As the moſt fragrant Roſes have their Prickles and Thorns, and the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Air is ſubject to be darkned with Clouds, as the cleareſe Sun to be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with an Ecclipſe, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt Health to be interrupted with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and Aches; ſo the greateſt worldly Succeſſes and Proſperities have their Interruptions, their Thorns of Cares and Diſturbances, their Clouds and Eclipſes to darken them.

               <p>O Eternal God, and Admirable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whoſe wiſe Diſpenſations and Orders of Providence are various; it is thy will that I ſhould be encompaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with Evils and Troubles. Haſt thou appointed to try my Patience and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by theſe Afflictions? Wilt thou lead me through theſe Briars and Thorns?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:31416:119"/>Muſt I ſuffer all theſe Loſſes and Croſſes, and drink this bitter Cup of thy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? I am content to do it, ſeeing it is thy Holy Will; and am perſwaded, that all theſe things ſhall turn to mine advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at laſt. My Griefs indeed are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and my Sorrows are multiplied. Nature cannot but complain at the ſight and ſenſe of ſo much Miſery; but I will give a check to my natural Affections, and will bring them to yield ſubmiſſion to thy Heavenly Wiſdom. What Noble Examples have I before me of thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of former Ages, who have been as ſeverely treated and tryed as I am, or like to be, and yet theſe were thy choſen and thy deareſt Children; and ſhall I miſinterpret theſe Corrections from thy Hand, and think them to be ſigns of thy Wrath? Shall I murmur to be handled as my great Saviour was, and drink in the ſame Cup of Affliction with him. He ſwallow'd the very dregs of Bitterneſs and Grief, but thy Mercy and Goodneſs has ſweetned my Cup with an infuſion of ſome contentments that are yet left me. Thou haſt not removed all my Delights, thou haſt not taken from me all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Expreſſions of thy Bounty; if thou afflicteſt me in one part of my ſelf, thou doſt comfort me in another, and thy Corrections are not ſo grievous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:31416:119"/>me of all help and ſatisfaction. O, my God, I humbly acknowledge that I deſerve a ſeverer treatment from thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice than I have yet experienced, and find that thy Mercy does ſpare my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and alleviate the burden that thou haſt laid upon me. I truſt that thou wilt not ſend greater Afflictions than I am able well to bear; and in due time thy Wiſdom will give me eaſe and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But I ſee by theſe proceedings the Sins and Provocations that I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of; by theſe Loſſes thou doſt mind me of that Idolatrous Affection that I gave away to theſe vanities. By theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations I perceive I abuſed theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercies; by this Adverſity thou doſt render my abode in the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, that I might long and ſeek for Heaven, and prepare my ſelf for thine Eternal Reſt. Bleſſed God, grant that I may rightly underſtand theſe excellent Admonitions of thy Providence; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer me to be ſo weary as to haſten, or be any ways inſtrumental in procuring my departure: I will wait thy leiſure and time, and ſuffer thy Divine Hand to diſpoſe of my Soul and Body. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, O my God, all thine Orders, let them be never ſo grievous, and let them take from me never ſo many worldly Comforts; I received them firſt from thy
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:31416:120"/>Liberality, and it is but juſt I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them to thee again when thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt. Naked I came into the World, and naked I muſt return back again. Whatever, O Heavenly Father, thou doſt condemn me to loſe, let me never loſe thy Favour; that will make a ſufficient amends for all my other Croſſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me greater advantages than the World can afford. Sanctifie, I beſeech thee, all the Actings of thy Providence to me. Cauſe me to make that improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is deſign'd. Wean my Heart and Affections from the World. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen thy Grace in me, that my Soul may be ſupported by Faith and Patience; and in the midſt of the greateſt Calamities, enjoy a Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. O, my God, <hi>I</hi> know thou canſt remove this Affliction from me, and bring a Remedy to my moſt ſenſible Griefs. I am perſwaded that in thy due time <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſee an alteration, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſee my Sorrows turn'd into Joys, my Sufferings into Eaſe, my Loſſes repaired, and all theſe Clouds of Affliction vaniſh and give way to the Sun-ſhine of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. However thou art pleaſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of me, <hi>I</hi> beſeech thee, caſt me not away from thine Eternal Preſence.

This Fever and theſe Aches admoniſh and ſpeak to me in that manner that thou, O my Heavenly Father, uſeſt to ſpeak to thy deareſt Children, in that manner that is moſt proper for me, and ſuitable to thy Grace and Wiſdom.

To thy Power and Mercy I flee in this time of my diſtreſs. I have little other comfort but in thine unſpeakable Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I beſeech thee not to deny to thy poor afflicted Creature and Servant. Lay not upon me a greater burden than I can well bear; and with theſe griefs of Body adminiſter inward Comforts to my precious Soul. Pardon and forgive all my Sins; reveal to me ſome aſſurances of

               <head>A Meditation and Prayer when the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Death appear.</head>
               <p>O Almighty God, and Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I perceive it is thy will to remove me out of this Earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to call me from my preſent ſtation, out of thy Vineyard, where I have been employed in thy Service. Lord, I confeſs my negligence and careleſneſs, that I have not been ſo diligent as in Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ought: The Task that thou haſt given me to end, I have but begun; the World and its Vanities have ſtole away my Cares, and employed too much of my precious time; and the pleaſures of Sin have bewitched my Soul, ſo that I have been, to my great grief, an unprofitable Servant. But, O my God, there is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with thee, and a ſufficiency of mercy, to pardon my greateſt and moſt hainous Offences. Declare, I beſeech thee, the Infiniteneſs of thy Mercy; in the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my notorious Tranſgreſſions; thou art able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto thee through my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Haſt thou been merciful to a Thief upon the Croſs, to a <hi>David</hi> and a <hi>Peter,</hi> to a <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> and the greateſt of Sinners, and wilt thou deny me a ſhare in this Divine
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:31416:128"/>Mercy! O ſtrengthen my Faith in thy Gracious Promiſes. I Believe, help thou mine Unbelief. I ſeek not unto thee with any confidence upon any merits or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in my ſelf or actions, but as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son, or poor Publican, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance upon thy pure and diſintereſſed Love, and the Blood of my Saviour, that ſpeaks better things than that of <hi>Abel.</hi> Caſt me not away from thy preſence now in the time of my diſtreſs, look upon my groans, my tears, and ſufferings. The pangs of death have already ſeized upon me, I am departing out of this miſerable World, my Soul is weary of this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Tabernacle of my Body, I feel my ſtrength decaying more and more, I ſee the Grave is ready to receive my Carcaſs, and the Worms to devour and feed upon it; let mine immortal Soul be precious in thy ſight, waſh and cleanſe it in the blood of the immaculate Lamb, ſlain and buried for my Sins, and riſen again for my Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</p>
               <p>Farewell vain World, that I have too much adored, and ſerved, thou art not able to aſſiſt me with any comfort or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in my need, but my dependance is upon my God, to his mercy alone I ſeek for ſhelter and relief. I now perceive the emptineſs of all thoſe things that worldly minds ſo highly eſteem; what advantage
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:31416:128"/>can I receive from my former Riches, from my Attendants and Friends! The Preferments, Grandure, and Titles of Honour cannot benefit me in my preſent Eſtate. Death is going to ſtrip me naked, and deprive me of all preſent Comforts; I ſee the folly of my paſt Labours, and extraordinary earneſtneſs after theſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Had I but any longer time to continue on Earth, I would flight theſe deceitful ſhadows of happineſs; I ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and more laſting happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, O my God, an Eternal happineſs in another Eſtate, not ſubject to any caſualty or change, ſecured to the owners by thine Almighty Power; grant me that I may attain unto it, that I may be admitted into thy Holy and Heavenly Sanctuary, that with the reſt of thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, I may be an Eternal Monument of thy Goodneſs and Mercy. Remove from me all diſorderly affections, compleat the good work that thou haſt begun in me, and accept of the groans and prayers that I ſhall breath out unto thee my Heavenly Father at my laſt gaſp; ſend thine Angels to Comfort and ſecure my Soul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this precious Being into thy Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Protection. Defend and preſerve me from the malice and temptation of all Evil Spirits, at this Critical and laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Look in mercy upon all my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:31416:129"/>that I leave behind me, ſupply the want of my Preſence, with the continual favours of thy good Providence; be thou a Father to the Fatherleſs, and a Husband to the Widows, a true Friend to ſuch as are forſaken; moderate their grief for my departure, with the aſſurance of a ſinal Reſurrection: Keep them all in thy fear and favour, from the Corruptions of the Age, and bring them to thine Eternal Kingdom.</p>
               <p>O my merciful God, I am weary of this wicked World, and painful Life, releaſe me at thy good and due time; and though I ſee a mournful Spectacle in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Body into loathſom duſt, I can ſee further, beyond my Grave, to the great and joyful Morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when thou ſhalt awaken this ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duſt of my Body, when thou ſhalt find out every Grain and Particle of this Earthly Tabernacle, to joyn it again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to live with thee for ever and ever. Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, receive me into thy Sacred Embraces; I will wait thy leiſure, ſend thine Holy Angels to convey my Soul into thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, that I may rejoyce for ever with thine Elect, and glorifie thy Mercy. Eaſe me of my grievous pains, relieve my ſorrowful Soul, comfort it with a Beam of thy Countenance: Thou haſt redeemed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:31416:129"/>it, O my ſweet Jeſus, receive it as thine own purchaſe; I yield it up unto thee. Turn my ſorrows into joys, my ſufferings and agony into pleaſures laid up at thy right hand: Aſſiſt me with thine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and plead for me, O my Heavenly Advocate. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Eternal Wiſdom, what a mercy is this! to Inſtruct and Teach us at our Doors, to enable, enlighten, inſpire and ſend Meſſengers ſo near our Dwellings, to direct us in the right way of Eternal Happineſs. What a condeſcention is this, to ſpeak to us in our own Language, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Capacities; by Men, whoſe preſence expreſs nothing but meekneſs and love! was it not ſufficient, O bleſſed God, that thou ſhouldeſt open to us the large Book of Nature, to inform us of thy Will and Sacred Laws, by ſo many Characters imprinted in every thing that is made? was it not ſufficient for our Learning, to ſhew us thy pleaſure in the ſeveral leaves of another Book of Providence, opened to us wide every day of our Life! but
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:31416:130"/>muſt thy tender compaſſion of our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ignorance, unmindfulneſs, and wilful corruption, teach us by ſuch plain eaſie and excellent methods, ſo full of kindneſs and love! Muſt the repetition be ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? muſt thou ſo often viſit and call upon us to ſtudy and meditate upon the Divine Matters! Certainly our minds are too much wedded to the World, and too much enclined to irregular actions, ſeeing thou haſt judged needful to repeat ſo often to us our Duties, and we want every weeks inſtruction to withdraw our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation from Evil and Vanity. Should not our diligence anſwer in ſome reſpect thy continual Care, O Merciful Wiſdom, and as frequently meet thee, as we are called upon by theſe Publick Summons! Doubtleſs the buſineſs that we are to mind is of importance, ſeeing my Creator thinks neceſſary to interpoſe his Divine Authority, and to ſpeak to us himſelf, though by the tongue of a Mortal Man. With what reverence and dread ought I to approach the gracious preſence of my God, who vouchſafes to ſpeak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me in ſuch a loving manner. His Word and Laws ſhould not in reaſon have the leſs power and impreſſion upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his condeſcention to my weakneſs and Capacity: Should I deſpiſe the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of my God, that are ſo great and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:31416:130"/>wonderful, delivered to me in earthen veſſels? O Bleſſed and Heavenly Wiſdom, I am called away from my Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to wait upon thee, and hearken to the Divine Matters that ſhall be propoſed, which relate to my Eternal Intereſt. Their excellency requires my attention and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent enquiry for this ſupernatural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is able to ſave my Soul. Here thou doſt reveal unto me what I am, and what I ſhould be, and what I ſhall be: Here are diſcovered the admirable Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Holy Trinity and Unity of the Incarnation and Redemption. Here thou doſt unboſome thy ſelf to mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſheweſt the tenderneſs of thine affection to us: Here I may have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the unſpeakable riches of Heaven, and ſee the Glories that are laid up for me in thine Eternal Sanctuary. Theſe are Matters worthy of the Angels prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; theſe are Meditations fit for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirits; and ſhall I neglect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, ſhall I idle away this precious moment deſigned for the benefit of mine immortal Soul? My gracious God, cauſe me to increaſe in Grace, and in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge of my Redemption, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten mine Underſtanding with a clear apprehenſion of the Heavenly Truths, Sanctifie the outward preaching of thy word, that it may be effectual, and able

Deliver me from the ill conſequences of Errors, Partiality and Prejudice, and make me truly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thee for this great Bleſſing. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move not thy Goſpel from us, but ſave us from the pernicious Plots of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Hereſie. Unite all of us in our Worſhip and Church, that we may ſtudy to preſerve the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. And being all together united now in the Church Militant, we may be all the more ready and prepared to enter in due time into the Church Triumphant, into that Glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Love and Peace, where our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſhall be compleated, our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perfected, and our Employment for ever ſhall be to Celebrate and Sing forth thy Praiſes with the Chorus of Heavenly Spirits. <hi>Amen.</hi>
